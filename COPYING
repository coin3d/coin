Coin is copyright (C) 1998-2005 by Systems In Motion (SIM). 
All rights reserved.

Coin is generally available under three software licenses.  Unless special
arrangements has been made with SIM, it is the Coin Free Edition that is
being used.

1) GNU General Public License ("GPL")

   SIM is a staunch supporter of Free Software.  We have benefited
   greatly (and continue to do so) from using Free Software ourselves.
   To contribute back, SIM distributes Coin freely under the GPL for use
   in Free Software.  Coin under the GPL is called the Coin Free Edition.
   See the file LICENSE.GPL for the full license text of the GPL.

2) Coin Professional Edition License ("Coin PEL")

   The Coin PEL is a personalized developer license for using Coin for all
   non-Free Software development.  The PEL gives you the right to develop
   and distribute proprietary applications with Coin3D and includes free
   technical support and upgrades.

   For information about acquiring Coin Professional Edition License,
   go to <URL:http://www.coin3d.org/Coin/prices.php>.  The full license
   text can be found at <URL:http://www.coin3d.org/Coin/PEL.txt>.

3) Coin Evaluation License ("Coin EL")

   The Coin EL is a time-limited software license for evaluation purposes,
   with rights similar to those granted by the PEL. The purpose of the
   Coin EL is to be used in an evaluation phase when deciding whether or
   not to choose the Coin PEL solution.

If you want to use Coin for academic projects or educational purposes,
and neither the GPL nor the Coin PEL are appropriate for you, special
accomodations might be made on a case-by-case basis.  Please contact us
at <sales@sim.no> for more information.
