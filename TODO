TODO:
=====

(format is: "* [author:conceived-date] item", listed in no particular order)

*** RENDERING ITEMS ***

* [mortene:1999????] make a library with the necessary functionality
  for doing nurbs curves and nurbs surfaces. Could perhaps start off
  with the code in Brian Paul's MIT-relicensed Mesa (if MesaGLU is
  part of that)?

* [mortene:1999????] support the SoRenderList and SoOctTreeOrdering
  stuff. Should at least provide a dummy implementation.


*** BUILD ITEMS ***

* [mortene:19991218] set up a "make test" target which can do
  regression testing. Take a look at the functionality offered by
  DejaGnu to see if it can be useful for our purposes.

* [pederb:19991217] demand at least version 2.8 when trying to compile
  with GCC (g++).

* [mortene:19991113] is it possible to get the make process to print
  out which dependency causes recompilation of a file? That would be a
  nice feature.

* [mortene:19991107] example programs and tools shouldn't be compiled
  with the COIN_INTERNAL define set.

* [mortene:19990912] get rid of Inventor/system/inttypes.h. Check to
  see if we can use the AC_COMPILE_CHECK_SIZEOF macro from the
  autoconf macro archive to find and define types for 8/16/32/64 bits.
  Update: a related item is part of the OpenSSH TODO list as of
  release 1.2.2, and there's some code in configure.in.

* [mortene:19990912] add options in configure for compiling slimmed
  versions of Coin (--without-coin-engines etc). Or perhaps make a
  single --compile-basesystem option instead?

* [mortene:19991226] search for the doxygen tool by using an autoconf
  macro.

* [mortene:19990913] integrate the doxygen man- and html-generation
  into "make install".

* [mortene:1999????] make Coin build under MSWindows with the Cygwin
  tools.

* [mortene:19991127] use the PETI_WITH_DMALLOC macro from the autoconf
  macro archives to optionally make with dmalloc
  (<http://www.dmalloc.com>).

*** GENERIC ITEMS ***

* [mortene:19991130] names containing (note: not only "beginning
  with") __ (double underscore) or beginning with _[A-Z] (single
  underscore immediately followed by an uppercase letter) are reserved
  in C++ for the implementation.

* [mortene:19991128] code restructuring: convert internal use of lists
  to SbList wherever possible.

* [mortene:19991124] write documentation for the tools (ivcat,
  ivhierarchy, ...)

* [kintel:19990928] test and fix problems with running on 64-bit
  platforms.

* [mortene:1999????] Use float-versions of math-functions on platforms
  where they are supported (i.e. fcos(), fsqrt() etc instead of cos(),
  sqrt(), ..). Use autoconf for testing availability.

* [mortene:19990930] SbString.h is incompatible with the std::string
  STL definition? Look into this to see if it can be solved. (Reported
  by Jason Fritz on coin-devsupport.)


*** SUPPORT ITEMS ***

* [mortene:19991115] move WWW pages from public_www module into Coin
  module and set up necessary mechanism on www.sim.no to extract and
  publish pages automatically.

* [mortene:19990807] make an overview list on the Coin WWW pages of
  what's implemented and what's not -- separate list into "vs OI 2.1"
  and "vs OI 2.5".

* [mortene:19991009] autogenerate Doxygen html documentation and
  publish on our Coin www pages.

* [mortene:19991016] convert documentation of functions to Doxygen's
  \param + \return format (this is a _huge_ and boring job, but it can
  be done gradually, of course).

* [mortene:19990913] write non-generic instructions in the INSTALL
  file.

* [mortene:19990913] fill in the ``HACKING'' file with tips & tricks
  for faster turn-around when doing development.
