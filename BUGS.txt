003 There are seams in texturemaps on SGI Octane with "IMPACTSR"
    graphics hardware.

    Can at least be seen on the SoGuiExamples/nodes/texture
    example. Reported by Dan Stewart on coin-discuss. Cause not yet
    known. Hard to debug and fix without access to the platform in
    question.

005 Free memory read on connected SoSFEnum fields?

    This is an old problem which might have been fixed now, but we
    should check it with Valgrind: Purify used to report "Free memory
    read" when deleting SoSFEnum fields that were connected to other
    fields.

    (Original test-code supplied by Nigel Murry.)

    Some other specifications for nurbscurves and nurbssurfaces tested
    works correctly.

    pederb has tracked this down to be likely to be caused by bugs in
    libGLU: a rendered curve is different from a tesselated curve (!).

    Hard to solve this *properly* without implementing our own
    nurbs-library, thereby dropping GLU. Are there any quick-fixes we
    could apply?

012 Buglet: the SoMaterial::shininess field is not clamped if it's >
    1.0. This causes OpenGL errors, at least with some drivers.

    (The other material field values are also likely to be able to
    cause problems like this.)

    Consider this bug a low priority item.

=====================================================================

017 If you drag one of the interaction tabs on an SoTabPlaneDragger
    past the one on the opposite side (that is: so the scaleFactor in
    that direction is close to 0.0), I can see 2 problems which are
    both probably related to the same bug:

        - the geometry "oscillates" around origo as long as the drag
          operation is held

        - if one releases the drag in this position, it's impossible
          to grab one of the tabs again (and the geometry is placed
          wrongly, use "View All" in an examiner viewer to see this)

    For convenience, here's the (trivial) scenegraph one can use to
    reproduce the problem in any viewer component:

    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---
    #Inventor V2.1 ascii

    TabPlaneDragger { }
    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---

    I *guess* this should be fixed by placing some lower bound on the
    scalevector values, that somehow matches the lower reaches of
    floating point accuracy that we can still safely use without
    getting the artifacts mentioned above.

=====================================================================

018 SoTransformerDragger has a bug where the transformation matrix can
    end up with shearing.

    Here's a simple way of reproducing the bug: click and drag the
    middle front rotation point after loading the following scene (and
    changing the viewpoint slightly, so the camera direction is not
    normal to it). Upon releasing the rotation invokation, the
    geometry of the Text3 will be slightly sheared, indicating a
    faulty transform matrix somewhere:

    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---
    #Inventor V2.1 ascii

    Separator {
       TransformerManip { }
       Text3 { string "b"   parts ALL }
    }
    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---

    The bug is also listed in the topmost FIXME in
    src/draggers/SoTransformerDragger.cpp, so update that comment
    aswell if you fix the problem.

    mortene 20020813.

=====================================================================

019 When using the CTRL key while doing scaling with
    SoTransformerDragger (to scale against the corner point on the
    opposite side), the geometry will jump by an offset both on
    pushing and releasing the CTRL key.

    For convenience, here's a (trivial) scenegraph to reproduce the
    problem:

    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---
    #Inventor V2.1 ascii

    Separator {
       TransformerManip { }
       Text3 { string "b"   parts ALL }
    }
    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---

    This bug basically renders the "CTRL-scaling" feature unusable.

    The bug is also listed in a FIXME near the top in
    src/draggers/SoTransformerDragger.cpp, so update that comment
    aswell if you fix the problem.

020 There is a crash bug when changing the parts of an
    SoTransformBoxDragger. It can be reproduced with this stand-alone
    example:

    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---
    #include <Inventor/Qt/SoQt.h>
    #include <Inventor/Qt/viewers/SoQtExaminerViewer.h>

    #include <Inventor/nodes/SoSeparator.h>


    int
    main(int argc, char ** argv)
    {
      QWidget * window = SoQt::init(argv[0]);

      SoTransformBoxDragger * dragger = new SoTransformBoxDragger;

      SbString str;
      for (int i = 1; i <= 6; i++) {
        str.sprintf("translator%d.translator", i);
        dragger->setPart(str.getString(), new SoSeparator);
      }

      SoQtExaminerViewer * viewer = new SoQtExaminerViewer(window);
      viewer->setSceneGraph(dragger);
      viewer->show();
      SoQt::show(window);

      SoQt::mainLoop();

      delete viewer;
      return 0;
    }
    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---

    The bugs pop up at application *exit*, but not every time -- you
    will typically have to try 4 or 5 times to get it to bug out.

    Here's the backtrace from the first indication that something is
    wrong (ie the first SoDebugError posting):

    UPDATE 20021010 mortene: pederb fixed a bug that seems to be
    caused by the same error as this one. The bug was never really
    *understood*, though, which seems dangerous.. see the FIXME code
    comment in SoChildList::remove().

    UPDATE 20021014 rolvs: I tried to reintroduce the bug by undoing
    the change done by pederb as described in SoChildList::remove()
    FIXME. I was not able to reproduce the described effect. I'm
    investigating this further, as there seem to be some gravel in the
    list-machinery. (See FIXME in SoChildList::insert)

    UPDATE 20021209 rolvs: Consider this fixed and remove from BUGS?
    (Still unable to reproduce)

=====================================================================
025 Import hangs on invalid scenegraph. This reproduces the problem:

    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---
    #VRML V2.0 utf8
    
    Group {
       children [
          *
       ]
    }
    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---

    The '*' character can be replaced by any character not valid in
    identifier names, and the bug will still be present.

    Should of course never hang, but rather spit out an error message
    and abort the import process.

=====================================================================

026 Bounding box calculation: the bbox for the Barcelona.iv model is
    _very_ sub-optimal. (SGI Inventor seems to make a perfect fit.)

    Update, some further investigations made: the bug disappears if we
    remove the invalid face (there are two "-1" in a row in the
    coordIndex field). Bbox-calculation code should match the
    rendering code in what action to take when detecting this case, so
    bboxes matches the geometry that actually gets rendered.

028 So[SM]FString I/O problem
    " characters in strings aren't backslash-quoted when exported to
    file.  This causes the fields to get another value when it is
    read in again.

    This indicates that there is a general problem with not backslash-
    quoting string characters that need quoting, or maybe octal
    representation (if that is a valid string character representation).

    Related to this, the string reader doesn't jump in and out of
    quoted-string-mode when it encounters unquoted "-characters that
    open or close strings in the middle of the string.  I'm not sure
    if what's the correct behaviour is specified in any file format
    specification though - maybe the VRML1/VRML97 specs?.  If not,
    SGI Inventor would serve as the reference implementation on this
    issue.

    SoAsciiText * text = new SoAsciiText;
    text->string.set1Value(0, "\"quoted string\"");
    writeaction.apply(text);

    When read in again, this is read in as the two strings "quoted" and
    "string\"\"," - the last , coming from the multi-field separator,
    I guess.

    I would expect the last to be just "string" if the quoted-string-mode
    switching worked like in the Bourne shell where you can write
    h""ey" yo"u to produce the string "hey you".  The C string syntax
    would perhaps be more natural to compare with - there this kind of
    stuff isn't allowed at all.

029 SoSFEnum / SoMFEnum / SoSFBitMask / SoMFBitMask can't be used for
    SoUnknownNode. The following will not import properly in Coin, but
    rather elicit a read error message:

    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---
    #Inventor V2.1 ascii
    
    MarkerKit {
       fields [ SFEnum outerShape ]
       outerShape 0
    }
    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---

    The error message is:

        Coin read error: no mappings available for SoSFEnum field
        outerShape

    The reason for this problem is that the import code expects to use
    an SoSFEnum field that has been set up with a full set of enum
    values <-> names mappings. This is not the case for SoUnknownNode
    fields.

    What should be done about this is probably to be more "slack"
    about allowing SoSFEnum et al to be used _without_ name mappings
    (at least in certain contexts).

    Consider this bug a low priority item.

030 Running larsa's 'iv2scenegraph' tool (from SmallChange/test-code/)
    on the good old windmill.iv model (and probably others aswell)
    makes it output a PNG that is "skewed".

    Most likely an SoOffscreenRenderer bug (perhaps with the unlimited
    buffer size functionality), but more investigation is needed.

    20020924 mortene.

    UPDATE 20021121 larsa:  I think Øystein has fixed the skewing
    problem now - don't know if he has been instructed to update this
    file when fixing bugs?  Anyways, he has other problems with the
    offscreen renderer he is working on.

=====================================================================

031 Setting up the alpha channel for the offscreen renderer doesn't
    consistently (between hosts) produce a transparent background when
    using setComponents(SoOffscreenRenderer::RGB_TRANSPARENCY).  It
    works at home on my Debian Linux w/ GeForce4MX440 with the 3123
    NVIDIA GLX sources, but not at work with whatever gfx system I
    have there.

    UPDATE 20020927 mortene: this could simply be caused by the GLX /
    X11 drivers lacking support for any alpha-enabled visuals
    (according to spec, it is not guaranteed that any such visual is
    available). Anyway, the right way to solve this problem is to 1)
    write our own weight-function for X11 visuals (like it's been done
    for MSWin visuals in SoWin's SoWinGLWidget.cpp), for better
    control of the selection process. Then 2) warn the user if we
    can't get hold of any visual capable of all requested features.

    UPDATE 20021022 larsa: this was the case - old XFree3 with old
    Mesa does not support alpha for offscreen rendering.

    UPDATE 20021121 larsa: The offscreen renderer GL context creation
    is nevertheless bogus (with GLX at least), and should be fixed so
    the best possible context is created.

033 Some of the default geometry files for dragger geometries uses an
    SoDrawStyle::lineWidth > 1.0. This can be outside the legal range
    of the OpenGL implementation, which only guarantees that 1.0 can
    be used. (We have indeed received at least one problem report due
    to this.)

    I'm working on a solution for this, which involves setting up some
    new global fields which contains the legal ranges of glLineWidth()
    and glPointSize(). From .iv-files, one can then connect to these
    global fields.

=====================================================================

034 The rendering performance when loading
    Coin/data/draggerDefaults/transformerDragger.iv into an
    examinerviewer seems disproportionately bad versus what one would
    expect (it doesn't look like it contains all that much geometry).

    Should investigate why this happens. (Do a profile run, perhaps?)

    This is a high priority task, which is probably hard enough to
    debug that it should be left to pederb.  ;-)

    Found and reported on coin-discuss by Coin-user Martin Vogt.

    A few interesting findings after some fiddling with the .iv-file
    in question:

        - SGI Inventor renders the geometry of the file with a lot
          better performance than Coin-2

        - turning off transparency in all materials doesn't help

        - blanking out all materials in general doesn't help

        - changing TRANSFORMER_ROTATOR_MARKER to be an SoLabel instead
          of an SoSphere speeds up rendering *dramatically* (fps goes
          from ~7 to ~50 on my home machine), even though from a quick
          look I believe that only removes 18 spheres from the scene

        - removing all SoIndexedFaceSet instances alone doesn't seem
          to help much (fps stays about the same)

        - removing all SoIndexedLineSet instances alone doesn't seem
          to help much (fps stays about the same)

        - removing all SoIndexedFaceSet and SoIndexedLineSet instances
          *together* causes a jump in fps approximately equal to the
          one when removing the spheres

    20021007 mortene.
    
    UPDATE 20030204 pederb. With auto-caching Coin now renders this
    file quite a lot faster than SGI Inventor (41 fps for Coin, 32 fps
    for SGI Inventor :)

036 This program will hit an assert if we interact with the
    SoTrackballDragger at the same time as it is removed from the

    Should of course be robust and handle this properly without
    crashing, even though this is a rather obscure problem.

    (Consider this bug a low-priority item.)

    I did some quick checking on a few other draggers, and they seem
    to handle getting destructed while they are interacted
    with. Should check all of them after fixing this
    SoTrackballDragger bug, though.

    Investigate to find the exact cause. If it's our bug, fix. If it's

    We should of course never crash when importing any .iv or .wrl

    Using circular connections for fields is pretty obscure, so

043 We're writing invalid VRML97 files.

    According to spec, '+' is not allowed as a first character of
    nodes names in VRML97. But upon writing a scene graph from Coin,
    nameless nodes that are referenced from other nodes is still
    written to disk as "DEF +0", "DEF +1", etc.

    For how to fix properly, see Coin/docs/todo.txt, item #003.

044 Release builds on Cygwin/MSVC++ doesn't heed all configure
    options.

    Specifically, "--disable-symbols" should remove the "/Zi" option
    to cl.exe, and "--enable-optimization" should add "/O2" (or some
    such).

    20021118 mortene, problem reported by Michael Wimmer on
    coin-discuss.

    20021118 larsa - the --disable-symbols problem is fixed, and I'm
    against adding "--enable-optimization".  The users should rather
    specify the optimization options they want in CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS.

    20021121 larsa: since Autoconf automatically adds -O2, we should
    consider adding an option to remove that option, if it can be
    made to work without touching user-set CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS and only
    the autoconf-set optimization-options.  Tricky stuff...

    happen around an off-center axis. (Off CenterballManip center)
    This happen for rotations around all the axis.

    NOTE: The bug is not visible if there is no connected geometry, or
    if the geometry is 'simple', like one cube or one cone.

046 Should interrupt attempts at 3D-texturing early when OpenGL can't
    do it.

    Kristofer Tingdahl reported on coin-discuss that attempts to use
    3D-texturing on a non-3D-texture capable platform (for instance on
    remote/indirect rendering -- see code comments near top of
    Coin/src/glue/gl.c) causes weird errors, like 3D-textures being
    rescaled to 0x0x1.

    The rescaling happens from within SoGLImage.cpp, but attempts at
    3D-texturing should be checked versus driver capabilities much
    earlier (in SoTexture3, perhaps?) so that the rescaling code never
    gets executed.

    If 3D-textures are attempted used but are not available, there
    should be an *elaborate* SoDebugError::postWarning() that explains
    why.

047 SoAntiSquish seems to trigger a bug in our matrix factoring code.

    From a coin-discuss posting by Philippe Debanné:

    ----8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] --      
    
    I am planning to design my own Dragger class and have been looking
    at the Toolmaker Ch. 8 examples: TranslateRadialDragger and
    RotTransDragger.  I found an unexpected behaviour of
    RotTransDragger (top-left of scene): When dragging one of the
    SoRotateCylindricalDraggers, the dragger will switch from rotation
    to scaling up as the mouse position approaches and goes beyond the
    bounding cylinder of the (spherical) dragger.  In fact, the
    dragger should not do any scaling up/down!! This happens
    systematically when dragging the horizontal band left or right
    (Y-axis rotation).

    When I comment out the SoAntiSquish part of RotTransDragger, this
    unexpected behaviour dissapears (But obviously you want the
    AntiSquish's anti-squishing behaviour!).  Alternately, if I set
    its 'recalcAlways' field to FALSE, I get a different strange
    behaviour: manipulation of the RotTransDragger affects the
    rendering of the RotTransManip to the right of it: its
    antisquishing scaling factor and fluctuations of its wire-mesh
    sphere.  All this seems to be independant of the AntiSquish
    'sizing' field, e.g.  BIGGEST_DIMENSION or LONGEST_DIAGONAL.

    pederb has investigated, and found that this seems likely to be a
    problem with our SbMatrix code that factors the translation,
    scaling and rotation out of a matrix.

048 Building SGI InventorXt on top of Coin reveals compile-time
    incompabilities.

    A Coin user reported two problems on coin-discuss:

        - InventorXt uses an Inventor-internal include file:
          Inventor/SoDebug.h. This contains a set of static debugging
          helper methods. They seem easy enough to implement, so
          perhaps we should do that.

        - Some explicit inclusion of SbTime.h is needed with Coin,
          that is not necessary with SGI Inventor. This is an
          incompatibility that we would like to get rid of, to make
          porting _other_ code from SGI Inventor to Coin a literal
          no-brainer.

049 3ds file import seems to generate faulty SoTriangleStripSet nodes.

    This happens for most of the models I've tried:

        Coin error in SoSeparator::GLRenderBelowPath(): GL error:
        GL_INVALID_VALUE, nodetype: TriangleStripSet

    And the models are not being influenced by the light source(s) in
    the scene.

050 We can't read files where DEF-names includes "[" and "]" chars.

    Here's a simple file to reproduce with (load with
    SoDB::readAll()):

    ----8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] --      
    #Inventor V2.1 ascii

    DEF test[0] Separator { }
    ----8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] --      

    This results in the following error messages, and a terminated
    import operation:

    ----8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] --      
    Coin read error: Premature end of file after DEF
            Occurred at line   3 in <ivfile>
    Coin read error: Invalid definition of test
            Occurred at line   3 in <ivfile>
    ----8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] --      

    SGI Inventor handles the same file with no problems.

051 ExaminerViewer's automatic initial "view all" doesn't work on
    a scene graph with SoImage.

    Reproduce with the following source code snippet. The
    "aass_logo.rgb" is an image of dimensions 80x68 (I haven't
    investigated if this matters or not).

    ----8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] --      
    #include <Inventor/Qt/SoQt.h>
    #include <Inventor/Qt/viewers/SoQtExaminerViewer.h>
    #include <Inventor/nodes/SoSeparator.h>
    #include <Inventor/nodes/SoImage.h>
    #include <Inventor/nodes/SoCone.h>
        
    int
    main(int argc, char* argv[])
    {
      QWidget * mainwin = SoQt::init(argv[0]);
    
      SoSeparator * root = new SoSeparator;
      root->ref();
    
      root->addChild(new SoCone);
    
      SoImage * img = new SoImage;
      root->addChild(img);
      img->filename = "aass_logo.rgb";
    
      SoQtExaminerViewer * viewer = new SoQtExaminerViewer(mainwin);
      viewer->setSceneGraph(root);
        
      SoQt::show(mainwin);
      SoQt::mainLoop();
    
      delete viewer;
      root->unref();
        
      return 0;
    }
    ----8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] --      

    Notice how the cone is a tiny dot in the lower left corner of the
    image at first. Then click view all (the eye icon) and see how the
    camera is then positioned where it should be. Correct behavior
    would be for the camera to be positioned there from the start.

052 MSWin dependency walker gives surprising results.

    We have a report that Coin and SoQt configure with
    --with-msvcrt=multithread-dynamic-debug will still have a
    dependency on *both* msvcrtd.dll and msvcrt.dll.

    Should investigate closer whether this is to be expected or not,
    and if yes, how this can happen.

054 SoComputeBoundingBox engine probably fails with viewport-dependent
    geometry.

    The SoGuiExamples/engines/computexfbbox example fails with a small
    scene with an SoText2 in it:

    ----8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] --      
    #Inventor V2.1 ascii

    Cube { }
    Translation { translation 10 0 0 }
    Text2 { string [ "hepp", "tjo-bing", "hupp" ] }
    ----8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] --      

    ..and pederb tracked this down to a failure of the engine's
    evaluate() to be called again when the camera position changes.

    Note that this bug is probably rather hard to fix properly.
