Now, for the list of known bugs in the core Coin library:


 =====================================================================

003 There are seams in texturemaps on SGI Octane with "IMPACTSR"
    graphics hardware.

    Can at least be seen on the SoGuiExamples/nodes/texture
    example. Reported by Dan Stewart on coin-discuss. Cause not yet
    known. Hard to debug and fix without access to the platform in
    question.

    <mortene@sim.no> 20020205.

=====================================================================

005 Free memory read on connected SoSFEnum fields?

    This is an old problem which might have been fixed now, but we
    should check it with Valgrind: Purify used to report "Free memory
    read" when deleting SoSFEnum fields that were connected to other
    fields.

    (Original test-code supplied by Nigel Murry.)

    Some other specifications for nurbscurves and nurbssurfaces tested
    works correctly.

    pederb has tracked this down to be likely to be caused by bugs in
    libGLU: a rendered curve is different from a tesselated curve (!).

    Hard to solve this *properly* without implementing our own
    nurbs-library, thereby dropping GLU. Are there any quick-fixes we
    could apply?

    <mortene@sim.no> 20020521.

=====================================================================

012 Buglet: the SoMaterial::shininess field is not clamped if it's >
    1.0. This causes OpenGL errors, at least with some drivers.

    (The other material field values are also likely to be able to
    cause problems like this.)

    Consider this bug a low priority item.

020 There is a crash bug when changing the parts of an
    SoTransformBoxDragger. It can be reproduced with this stand-alone
    example:

    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---
    #include <Inventor/Qt/SoQt.h>
    #include <Inventor/Qt/viewers/SoQtExaminerViewer.h>

    #include <Inventor/nodes/SoSeparator.h>


    int
    main(int argc, char ** argv)
    {
      QWidget * window = SoQt::init(argv[0]);

      SoTransformBoxDragger * dragger = new SoTransformBoxDragger;

      SbString str;
      for (int i = 1; i <= 6; i++) {
        str.sprintf("translator%d.translator", i);
        dragger->setPart(str.getString(), new SoSeparator);
      }

      SoQtExaminerViewer * viewer = new SoQtExaminerViewer(window);
      viewer->setSceneGraph(dragger);
      viewer->show();
      SoQt::show(window);

      SoQt::mainLoop();

      delete viewer;
      return 0;
    }
    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---

    The bugs pop up at application *exit*, but not every time -- you
    will typically have to try 4 or 5 times to get it to bug out.

    Here's the backtrace from the first indication that something is
    wrong (ie the first SoDebugError posting):

    20020821 mortene.

    UPDATE 20021010 mortene: pederb fixed a bug that seems to be
    caused by the same error as this one. The bug was never really
    *understood*, though, which seems dangerous.. see the FIXME code
    comment in SoChildList::remove().

    UPDATE 20021014 rolvs: I tried to reintroduce the bug by undoing
    the change done by pederb as described in SoChildList::remove()
    FIXME. I was not able to reproduce the described effect. I'm
    investigating this further, as there seem to be some gravel in the
    list-machinery. (See FIXME in SoChildList::insert)

    UPDATE 20021209 rolvs: Consider this fixed and remove from BUGS?
    (Still unable to reproduce)

=====================================================================

025 Import hangs on invalid scenegraph. This reproduces the problem:

    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---
    #VRML V2.0 utf8

    Group {
       children [
          *
       ]
    }
    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---

    The '*' character can be replaced by any character not valid in
    identifier names, and the bug will still be present.

    Should of course never hang, but rather spit out an error message
    and abort the import process.

    20020911 mortene.

=====================================================================

026 Bounding box calculation: the bbox for the Barcelona.iv model is
    _very_ sub-optimal. (SGI Inventor seems to make a perfect fit.)

    Update, some further investigations made: the bug disappears if we
    remove the invalid face (there are two "-1" in a row in the
    coordIndex field). Bbox-calculation code should match the
    rendering code in what action to take when detecting this case, so
    bboxes matches the geometry that actually gets rendered.

    20020915 mortene.

=====================================================================

028 So[SM]FString I/O problem
    " characters in strings aren't backslash-quoted when exported to
    file.  This causes the fields to get another value when it is
    read in again.

    This indicates that there is a general problem with not backslash-
    quoting string characters that need quoting, or maybe octal
    representation (if that is a valid string character representation).

    Related to this, the string reader doesn't jump in and out of
    quoted-string-mode when it encounters unquoted "-characters that
    open or close strings in the middle of the string.  I'm not sure
    if what's the correct behaviour is specified in any file format
    specification though - maybe the VRML1/VRML97 specs?.  If not,
    SGI Inventor would serve as the reference implementation on this
    issue.

    SoAsciiText * text = new SoAsciiText;
    text->string.set1Value(0, "\"quoted string\"");
    writeaction.apply(text);

    When read in again, this is read in as the two strings "quoted" and
    "string\"\"," - the last , coming from the multi-field separator,
    I guess.

    I would expect the last to be just "string" if the quoted-string-mode
    switching worked like in the Bourne shell where you can write
    h""ey" yo"u to produce the string "hey you".  The C string syntax
    would perhaps be more natural to compare with - there this kind of
    stuff isn't allowed at all.

    20020923 larsa.

    UPDATE 20030709 larsa: changes has been made wrt handling of
    double-quotes and backslashes a while ago, and I believe this
    problem has been fixed now.

    UPDATE 20040614 mortene: backslashes were backslashed, i.e. "\"
    would become "\\" on export. This does not match the behavior of
    SGI Inventor, and besides, we don't contract "\\" back to "\" upon
    import, so I changed the code to write "\" as "\" -- as I tested
    SGI Inventor to do.

=====================================================================

029 SoSFEnum / SoMFEnum / SoSFBitMask / SoMFBitMask can't be used for
    SoUnknownNode. The following will not import properly in Coin, but
    rather elicit a read error message:

    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---
    #Inventor V2.1 ascii

    MarkerKit {
       fields [ SFEnum outerShape ]
       outerShape 0
    }
    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---

    The error message is:

        Coin read error: no mappings available for SoSFEnum field
        outerShape

    The reason for this problem is that the import code expects to use
    an SoSFEnum field that has been set up with a full set of enum
    values <-> names mappings. This is not the case for SoUnknownNode
    fields.

    What should be done about this is probably to be more "slack"
    about allowing SoSFEnum et al to be used _without_ name mappings
    (at least in certain contexts).

    Consider this bug a low priority item.

    20020923 mortene.

=====================================================================

030 Running larsa's 'iv2scenegraph' tool (from SmallChange/test-code/)
    on the good old windmill.iv model (and probably others aswell)
    makes it output a PNG that is "skewed".

    Most likely an SoOffscreenRenderer bug (perhaps with the unlimited
    buffer size functionality), but more investigation is needed.

    20020924 mortene.

    UPDATE 20021121 larsa:  I think Øystein has fixed the skewing
    problem now - don't know if he has been instructed to update this
    file when fixing bugs?  Anyways, he has other problems with the
    offscreen renderer he is working on.

=====================================================================

031 Setting up the alpha channel for the offscreen renderer doesn't
    consistently (between hosts) produce a transparent background when
    using setComponents(SoOffscreenRenderer::RGB_TRANSPARENCY).  It
    works at home on my Debian Linux w/ GeForce4MX440 with the 3123
    NVIDIA GLX sources, but not at work with whatever gfx system I
    have there.

    UPDATE 20020927 mortene: this could simply be caused by the GLX /
    X11 drivers lacking support for any alpha-enabled visuals
    (according to spec, it is not guaranteed that any such visual is
    available). Anyway, the right way to solve this problem is to 1)
    write our own weight-function for X11 visuals (like it's been done
    for MSWin visuals in SoWin's SoWinGLWidget.cpp), for better
    control of the selection process. Then 2) warn the user if we
    can't get hold of any visual capable of all requested features.

    UPDATE 20021022 larsa: this was the case - old XFree3 with old
    Mesa does not support alpha for offscreen rendering.

    UPDATE 20021121 larsa: The offscreen renderer GL context creation
    is nevertheless bogus (with GLX at least), and should be fixed so
    the best possible context is created.

=====================================================================

032 The following lineset will render in SGI Inventor, but asserts
    in Coin (don't know what happens in non-debug builds).

    #Inventor V2.1 ascii

    Separator {
      Coordinate3 {
        point [ 0 0 0, 1 0 0, 2 0 0, 3 0 0 ]
      }
      IndexedLineSet {
        coordIndex [
          0, 1, -1,
          -1, # the offending empty line segment
          2, 3, -1
        ]
      }
    }

    In the long term, an optimized and a robust rendering method for
    this and related shapes should be implemented, and selected at
    run-time by the robust rendering method.

    20020927 larsa.

    UPDATE 20021010 mortene: fixed now?

=====================================================================

033 Some of the default geometry files for dragger geometries uses an
    SoDrawStyle::lineWidth > 1.0. This can be outside the legal range
    of the OpenGL implementation, which only guarantees that 1.0 can
    be used. (We have indeed received at least one problem report due
    to this.)

    I'm working on a solution for this, which involves setting up some
    new global fields which contains the legal ranges of glLineWidth()
    and glPointSize(). From .iv-files, one can then connect to these
    global fields.

    20020930 mortene.

    UPDATE 20040804 mortene: my idea mentioned above for a fix had a
    fatal flaw, so this problem is still unresolved.

=====================================================================

    Should of course be robust and handle this properly without
    crashing, even though this is a rather obscure problem.

    (Consider this bug a low-priority item.)

    I did some quick checking on a few other draggers, and they seem
    to handle getting destructed while they are interacted
    with. Should check all of them after fixing this
    SoTrackballDragger bug, though.

043 We're writing invalid VRML97 files.

    According to spec, '+' is not allowed as a first character of

    nameless nodes that are referenced from other nodes is still
    written to disk as "DEF +0", "DEF +1", etc.

    For how to fix properly, see Coin/docs/todo.txt, item #003.

=====================================================================

044 Release builds on Cygwin/MSVC++ doesn't heed all configure
    options.

    Specifically, "--disable-symbols" should remove the "/Zi" option
    to cl.exe, and "--enable-optimization" should add "/O2" (or some
    such).

    20021118 mortene, problem reported by Michael Wimmer on
    coin-discuss.

    20021118 larsa - the --disable-symbols problem is fixed, and I'm
    against adding "--enable-optimization".  The users should rather
    specify the optimization options they want in CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS.

    20021121 larsa: since Autoconf automatically adds -O2, we should
    consider adding an option to remove that option, if it can be
    made to work without touching user-set CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS and only
    the autoconf-set optimization-options.  Tricky stuff...

045 SoCenterballManip rotation off-center.

    When dragging the 'stripes' on a CenterballManip node, rotation
    happen around an off-center axis. (Off CenterballManip center)
    This happen for rotations around all the axis.

    NOTE: The bug is not visible if there is no connected geometry, or
    if the geometry is 'simple', like one cube or one cone.

    A simple scene-graph to reproduce:

    20021209 rolvs

    UPDATE 20030408 mortene: there is also a second bug here; the
    scene bounding box is not calculated correctly, as can be seen by
    loading this into e.g. the ExaminerViewer. The near clip plane
    will clip part of the manip's geometry, something which should
    never happen.

=====================================================================

046 Should interrupt attempts at 3D-texturing early when OpenGL can't
    do it.

    Kristofer Tingdahl reported on coin-discuss that attempts to use
    3D-texturing on a non-3D-texture capable platform (for instance on
    remote/indirect rendering -- see code comments near top of
    Coin/src/glue/gl.c) causes weird errors, like 3D-textures being
    rescaled to 0x0x1.

    The rescaling happens from within SoGLImage.cpp, but attempts at
    3D-texturing should be checked versus driver capabilities much
    earlier (in SoTexture3, perhaps?) so that the rescaling code never
    gets executed.

    If 3D-textures are attempted used but are not available, there
    should be an *elaborate* SoDebugError::postWarning() that explains
    why.

047 SoAntiSquish seems to trigger a bug in our matrix factoring code.

    From a coin-discuss posting by Philippe Debanné:

    ----8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] --

    I am planning to design my own Dragger class and have been looking
    at the Toolmaker Ch. 8 examples: TranslateRadialDragger and
    RotTransDragger.  I found an unexpected behaviour of
    RotTransDragger (top-left of scene): When dragging one of the
    SoRotateCylindricalDraggers, the dragger will switch from rotation
    to scaling up as the mouse position approaches and goes beyond the
    bounding cylinder of the (spherical) dragger.  In fact, the
    dragger should not do any scaling up/down!! This happens
    systematically when dragging the horizontal band left or right
    (Y-axis rotation).

    When I comment out the SoAntiSquish part of RotTransDragger, this
    unexpected behaviour dissapears (But obviously you want the
    AntiSquish's anti-squishing behaviour!).  Alternately, if I set
    its 'recalcAlways' field to FALSE, I get a different strange
    behaviour: manipulation of the RotTransDragger affects the
    rendering of the RotTransManip to the right of it: its
    antisquishing scaling factor and fluctuations of its wire-mesh
    sphere.  All this seems to be independant of the AntiSquish
    'sizing' field, e.g.  BIGGEST_DIMENSION or LONGEST_DIAGONAL.

    ----8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] --

    pederb has investigated, and found that this seems likely to be a
    problem with our SbMatrix code that factors the translation,
    scaling and rotation out of a matrix.

048 Building SGI InventorXt on top of Coin reveals compile-time
    incompabilities.

    A Coin user reported two problems on coin-discuss:

        - InventorXt uses an Inventor-internal include file:
          Inventor/SoDebug.h. This contains a set of static debugging
          helper methods. They seem easy enough to implement, so
          perhaps we should do that.

        - Some explicit inclusion of SbTime.h is needed with Coin,
          that is not necessary with SGI Inventor. This is an
          incompatibility that we would like to get rid of, to make
          porting _other_ code from SGI Inventor to Coin a literal
          no-brainer.

051 ExaminerViewer's automatic initial "view all" doesn't work on
    a scene graph with SoImage.

    Reproduce with the following source code snippet. The
    "aass_logo.rgb" is an image of dimensions 80x68 (I haven't
    investigated if this matters or not).

    ----8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] --

    #include <Inventor/nodes/SoSeparator.h>
    #include <Inventor/nodes/SoImage.h>
    #include <Inventor/nodes/SoCone.h>

    int
    main(int argc, char* argv[])
    {
      QWidget * mainwin = SoQt::init(argv[0]);

      SoSeparator * root = new SoSeparator;
      root->ref();

      root->addChild(new SoCone);

      SoImage * img = new SoImage;
      root->addChild(img);
      img->filename = "aass_logo.rgb";

      SoQtExaminerViewer * viewer = new SoQtExaminerViewer(mainwin);
      viewer->setSceneGraph(root);

      SoQt::show(mainwin);

      delete viewer;
      root->unref();

      return 0;
    }
    ----8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] --

    Notice how the cone is a tiny dot in the lower left corner of the
    image at first. Then click view all (the eye icon) and see how the
    camera is then positioned where it should be. Correct behavior
    would be for the camera to be positioned there from the start.

    20030103 mortene.

    WONTFIX? 20030225 rolvs: In this example, setSceneGraph calls
    viewAll() before the window is 'show'-ed. The viewport region
    passed to (*SoCamera)->viewAll( graph, vpreg ) is therefore wrong,
    causing a malformed boundingbox for the image and thus a malformed
    view.

    UPDATE 20030225 mortene: is there any simple and clean way to
    detect and handle this with a) a warning message for the app
    programmer, b) using a decent "dummy" / default region?

052 MSWin dependency walker gives surprising results.

    We have a report that Coin and SoQt configure with

    Should investigate closer whether this is to be expected or not,

054 SoComputeBoundingBox engine probably fails with viewport-dependent

    The SoGuiExamples/engines/computexfbbox example fails with a small

    ..and pederb tracked this down to a failure of the engine's
    evaluate() to be called again when the camera position changes.

    Note that this bug is probably rather hard to fix properly.

057 SoClipPlaneManip's reported dragger position is buggy.

    This problem was reported by Wouter Bosma, and can be reproduced
    with the example below: notice how the dragger position is first
    reported at <0, 0, 0>, then for any miniscule drag along the X
    axis, the position will be reported as <x, 0, 1.0>. That z=1.0 is

    Group {
      children
    }
    ----8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] --

    Partly tracked down: there is something fishy about how we handle
    empty group nodes -- it seems like a NULL pointer get added to the
    SoMFNode field. It might be two bugs here: *no* children should be
    set up (instead of the single NULL child), and NULL child pointers
    should _probably_ not be allowed by SoMFNode.

    UPDATE: pederb checked with the VRML97 grammar, and according to
    that, only SoSFNode fields are allowed to store NULL pointers.

    UPDATE: kintel also had a related bug report. This file:

    ----8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] --

    PROTO Object [ field MFNode children NULL ] {

      This is a special case as it is already a VRML2 file. However, I
      guess the action will also fail given a mixed scene graph as
      input. This is a bigger issue since we often have situations
      with mixed scene graphs and want to convert them to VRML2."

    We've also had at least one external report from a user who found
    this to be a real problem. From the problem report:

      After some tests I've found that the problem seems to be that
      VRML shapes instead of being copied through by the ToVRML2
      action (they are obviously already VRML2), they are deleted
      (ignored?). It looks like that src/actions/SoToVRML2Action.cpp
      lacks one more callback to handle nodes already in VRML2 format.

    This is a medium priority item.

    FIX: The correct thing to do is to track downwards to the "uppermost"
    place in the call-stack where whatever causes this error condition is
    still an _invalid_ condition. Then go one more step down and catch the
    problem there (by spitting out a warning and otherwise handle the
    condition gracefully (don't crash or assert)).

065 libtool.m4 needs upgrading

    http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=190223

    The current version we use doesn't support MIPS shared libs.
    The current version of libtool.m4 contains some Coin-specific
    tweaks though (Mac OS X stuff amongst others) that we need to
    inspect and check if are still needed before replacing libtool.m4

    20030424 larsa. Reported through Steve Robbins by Ryan Murray.

    Update 20030424 kyrah: AFAIK, only the convenience library hack
    [http://sim.no/~kyrah/patches/20021217_libtool.patch] in ltmain.sh
    is necessary for Mac OS X - at least that was the only thing I had
    to change for Coin-2. This is a known libtool problem, and is
    fixed in libtool-1.4.3 and libtool-1.5, according to Fink
    developer Peter O'Gorman.

    See the VRML1 file below containing 5 line segments as separate
    linesets.  Using this file, the viewAll button in the examiner
    viewer only _almost_ zooms out the camera enough: parts of the
    model is outside the view.

    To reproduce:

    o Open model in an examiner viewer.
    o Resize the window so height ~= 2* width.
    o Rotate the model so you get minimal total height in the view.
    o Press viewall. If my problems doesn't show, rotate around the up
      axis and press viewall repeatedly until error occurs.

    I tried the model in the SoGuiExamples/engines/computexfbbox
    example, and the bounding box gets calculated correctly. I guess
    that means there's a bug in either SoCamera::viewAll() or in
    SoGuiViewer::viewAll() -- most likely the latter.

070 SoNode::copyContents() bug.

    This bug report came on coin-discuss:

    --------------8<----------- [snip] ------------------8<--------
    I'm trying to port ivperf to Windows, and came across this strange
    problem -

    When it calls SoNode::copyContents, I get an assert thrown in
    SoFieldContainer::findCopy (which was called from
    SoMFNode::fixCopy).  It complains that the "copiedinstancestack"
    hasn't been created. (line 735)

    Now, looking at the code, it appears that the copiedinstancestack
    and friends only get created by a call from SoNode::copy, not
    SoNode::copyContents.  Is this a bug in Coin or ivperf?

    I had a brief look through the SGI Inventor source, and it appears
    that their findCopy would return NULL if the dictionary hadn't
    been created. Is this the correct behaviour?

    --------------8<----------- [snip] ------------------8<--------

    We should probably match the semantics of SoNode::copyContents()
    in SGI Inventor 100% -- that is, _unless_ the "return NULL"
    strategy is just a stupid robustness bug work-around in SGI
    Inventor.

    Investigate.

072 Assert failure when writing extension nodekit in binary format.

    Running the example program below causes the following assert to

      Aborted

    This points at some very nasty error, where some part of the scene
    graph is not tagged for writing on the first SoWriteAction pass,
    but is still attempted written on the second pass.

    It's really lame that we have this kind of bug at all, as having
    the two passes traverse the same structures shouldn't be rocket
    science.

    When writing as ASCII, the assert does *not* hit -- which means

    pederb's comments on the bug:

        We handled this earlier, but when adding proper support for
        auto-caching, it was easier to store everything for a texture
        object inside the texture object, and then identify it with a
        single uint32. Then it's quite easy to figure out the current
        texture object after a display list has been executed (the
        render-cache must store the OpenGL state changes it does so
        that SoGLLazyElement is updated after the display list has
        been executed). I could add additional variables for storing
        the filter settings, but I just couldn't see any practical
        reason for doing this.

    UPDATE 20040714 mortene: an external Coin user (Nigel Murry) had
    an ingenious way to use a texture multiple times with varying
    complexity settings, which now fails -- so there are indeed
    practical uses for this. So we should really consider this a bug,
    and a fairly high priority item aswell, as this is a regression
    versus older Coin versions.

    From Murry's bug report on coin-discuss:

        I have been using textures to show how some parameter (like
        say temperature) varies over the surface of an
        object. Sometimes I would like to see distinct color bands and
        other times I would like to see a continuous variation of
        color. So I have a SoTexture2 defined using 8 or 16 color
        levels. Then I change bewteen a "banded" and a continuous
        display using a SoComplexity node with textureQuality set to
        0.00001 for a banded display.

        That normally works fine, but when the texture is used more
        than once there appears to be some confusion as to how the
        textureQuality is used. In the attached little iv file, if the
        switch at line 7 is off (whichChild=-1) then the second
        (legend) use is correct. If the switch at line 7 is on
        (whichChild=-3) then the second use shows a continuous
        texture.

=====================================================================

074 SoComplexity::textureQuality changes must be made before
    SoTexture2 traversal.

    In the "Inventor spirit" of appearance settings not having any
    effect until hitting a shape node, it should be possible to do
    this:

    --------------8<----------- [snip] ------------------8<--------
    #Inventor V2.1 ascii

    Separator {
      Texture2 {
         image 2 2 3
         0xffffff 0x00ff00   # white   green
         0xff0000 0xffff00   #  red    yellow
      }

      Complexity { textureQuality 0 }

      Cube { }
    }
    --------------8<----------- [snip] ------------------8<--------

    ..but the SoComplexity node will have no effect in this case. I
    feel it should.

    Note that SGI Inventor doesn't handle this either, but I still
    think it is a weakness in Coin which we should fix.

075 SoHandleBoxManip does not behave correctly when locking a
    translation axis.

    To reproduce, load this simple iv-file into an examinerviewer:

    --------------8<----------- [snip] ------------------8<--------
    #Inventor V2.1 ascii

    HandleBoxManip { }
    --------------8<----------- [snip] ------------------8<--------

    ..then hold down SHIFT while LMB-clicking on one of the sides (for
    translation). The translation will correctly be locked to one
    axis, but when releasing the SHIFT button, the manip will jump to
    the current cursor location. This last behavior is incorrect.

    20030922 mortene.

=====================================================================

076 SoHandleBoxManip does not behave well upon "deep Z translation".

    To reproduce, load this simple iv-file into an examinerviewer:

    --------------8<----------- [snip] ------------------8<--------
    #Inventor V2.1 ascii

    HandleBoxManip { }
    --------------8<----------- [snip] ------------------8<--------

    ..then move the box out to the left side of the view
    (i.e. translate in -X), before LMB-clicking the right side of the
    box to translate in the Z direction. The manip will correctly move
    in the Z direction when moving the mouse cursor to the right, but
    upon continuing moving the mouse cursor to the right it suddenly
    misbehaves by first jumping back close to the camera, and then
    starting to move in the *negative* Z direction.

    This is clearly bad handling of some kind of border case.

077 Buggy reference counting upon scene graph export.

    Yet more of the embarrassing writeref counting errors. Trigger the
    bug by running the IvExamples/Mentor/14.1.FrolickingWords example,
    then type in 'dumpiv' to trigger a scene graph export
    operation. Application will exit with the following assert:

        Coin/src/misc/SoBase.cpp:251: void set_current_writeref(const
        SoBase *, int): Assertion `rc >= 0 && "buggy writerefcounter"'
        failed.

=====================================================================

078 Perl "soft" dependency not properly handled.

    The doxy4win.pl script is attempted run under MSWindows during
    build, even when Perl is not installed on the system.

    Should at least use a configure check for a working Perl
    interpreter, and disable document generation if not present. (Or
    perhaps try to solve this by removing the Perl dependency.)

    This is a very minor problem.

=====================================================================

079 SoPolygonOffset node only works for offsetting polygons?

    The following example should, AFAICU, offset the lineset to
    overlay the polygon:

    --------------8<----------- [snip] ------------------8<--------
    #Inventor V2.1 ascii

    Separator {
       Coordinate3 { point [ -1 -1 0, 1 -1 0, 1 1 0, -1 1 0 ] }

       BaseColor { rgb 0 0.5 0 }
       FaceSet { numVertices [ 4 ] }

       PolygonOffset {
         styles LINES
         units -1.0
       }

       BaseColor { rgb 1 1 0 }
       IndexedLineSet { coordIndex [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 2, -1, 1, 3 -1 ] }
    }
    --------------8<----------- [snip] ------------------8<--------

    ..but at least on my box (Linux, NVidia drivers) this doesn't
    work. Offsetting the polygons works as expected. According to
    pederb, SoPolygonOffset is often seen to have problems on points
    and lines. Should investigate more platforms and see if line /
    point offsetting works at all on any of them -- if not, this
    smells of a Coin bug.

    I consider this a minor to medium priority problem.

=====================================================================

082 Configure/build problem: we need to demand X11 when using GLX.

    As it is now, it's possible on certain platforms (at least
    experienced on Sun Solaris) that GLX linking is found to be ok by
    configure, even though X11 linking failed.

    This will then cause problems at compile or linkage later on, so
    we should detect this in the configure script and warn properly.

086 GLU bug in our NURBS code.

    In SoGL.cpp:sogl_set_nurbs_complexity(), we use the
    GLU_OBJECT_PARAMETRIC_ERROR enum to gluNurbsProperty() to set the
    GLU_SAMPLING_METHOD for tessellation.

    But this enum is only supported by versions of the GLU library
    that supports the GLU_EXT_object_space_tess extension. Microsoft's
    GLU library (version 1.2.2.0) does at least not support this
    extension, which means most developers using Coin on Windows will
    see no effect of modifying SoComplexity::value. So this bug is
    somewhat serious.

    20031119 mortene. Problem reported by Cristian Luciano.

=====================================================================

087 Scene graph with SoNurbsProfile hangs (?) rendering.

    The scene graph below causes rendering to hang (that's at least
    what it looks like) when the SoNurbsProfile node is present (and
    works fine without it). Note: this is most likely a GLU bug, and
    so it might not hang on all versions of the library.

    This might have a similar cause as bug #086, but I haven't
    investigated further.

    It also hangs with SGI Inventor.

    20031119 mortene. Problem reported by Cristian Luciano.

=====================================================================

088 Insecure GLU wrapping.

    We're not checking the presence of the GLU_EXT_nurbs_tessellator
    string in gluGetString(GLU_EXTENSIONS), we just assume it's ok if
    the function symbols are available in the GLU DLL image.

=====================================================================


089 SoComplexity::value has no visible effect on SoNurbsSurface.

    Changing the complexity in the scene graph below does not have any
    visible effect on the NURBS surface. This seems peculiar.

    SGI Inventor does not react much to changes in SoComplexity::value
    for this model either, so it's probably a GLU thing.

    This is probably a difficult debugging task, with the need to dig
    into the GLU library source code.

    This should not be considered a high priority task.

=====================================================================

090 Scene graph copy behavior deviates from SGI Inventor.

    For the code example below, we get different behavior on
    connection copying between Coin and SGI Inventor. For Coin, the
    node with the slave field is not copied (the connection is just
    shortcut), while it is copied for SGI Inventor.

-----8<------ [snip] ------------8<------ [snip] -------
#include <assert.h>

#include <Inventor/SoDB.h>
#include <Inventor/nodes/SoRotor.h>
#include <Inventor/SoLists.h>

int
main(void)
{
  SoDB::init();

  SoRotor * masterrotor = new SoRotor;
  SoRotor * slaverotor = new SoRotor;

  SoRotor * rotor = new SoRotor;

  rotor->rotation.connectFrom(&masterrotor->rotation);
  slaverotor->speed.connectFrom(&rotor->speed);

  printf("rotor==%p, masterrotor==%p, slaverotor==%p\n",
         rotor, masterrotor, slaverotor);


  SoRotor * copiedrotor = (SoRotor *)rotor->copy(TRUE);

  SoField * f;
  SbBool ok = copiedrotor->rotation.getConnectedField(f);
  assert(ok);
  SoRotor * copiedmaster = (SoRotor *)f->getContainer();

  SoFieldList slavelist;
  int nr = copiedrotor->speed.getForwardConnections(slavelist);
  assert(nr==0 || nr==1);
  SoRotor * copiedslave = nr ? (SoRotor *)slavelist[0]->getContainer() : NULL;

  printf("copiedrotor==%p, copiedmaster==%p, copiedslave==%p\n",
         copiedrotor, copiedmaster, copiedslave);

  return 0;
}
-----8<------ [snip] ------------8<------ [snip] -------

    A test run:

    Coin:
        rotor==0x807d3c0, masterrotor==0x807c740, slaverotor==0x807ce18
        copiedrotor==0x807e248, copiedmaster==0x807c740, copiedslave==(nil)

    SGI Inventor:
        rotor==0x8058710, masterrotor==0x8051690, slaverotor==0x8057ae0
        copiedrotor==0x8059cb8, copiedmaster==0x8051690, copiedslave==0x8059df0

    (Notice the differences for 'copiedslave'.)

    This is a quite nasty bug, which can cause hard to debug errors
    when moving code from SGI Inventor to Coin.

=====================================================================

091 Scene graph copy with engines deviates from SGI Inventor.

    The example below behaves differently for Coin and SGI Inventor.

-----8<------ [snip] ------------8<------ [snip] -------
#include <assert.h>

#include <Inventor/SoDB.h>
#include <Inventor/engines/SoCompose.h>
#include <Inventor/engines/SoElapsedTime.h>
#include <Inventor/nodes/SoRotor.h>
#include <Inventor/SoLists.h>

int
main(void)
{
  SoDB::init();

  SoRotor * slaverotor = new SoRotor;

  SoElapsedTime * time = new SoElapsedTime;
  SoComposeRotation * masterrotor = new SoComposeRotation;
  masterrotor->axis.setValue(0.0, 1.0, 0.0);
  masterrotor->angle.connectFrom(&time->timeOut);

  SoRotor * rotor = new SoRotor;

  rotor->rotation.connectFrom(&masterrotor->rotation);
  slaverotor->speed.connectFrom(&rotor->speed);

  printf("rotor==%p, masterrotor==%p, slaverotor==%p\n",
         rotor, masterrotor, slaverotor);


  SoRotor * copiedrotor = (SoRotor *)rotor->copy(TRUE);

  SoEngineOutput * f;
  SbBool ok = copiedrotor->rotation.getConnectedEngine(f);
  assert(ok);
  SoComposeRotation * copiedmaster = (SoComposeRotation *)f->getContainer();

  SoFieldList slavelist;
  int nr = copiedrotor->speed.getForwardConnections(slavelist);
  assert(nr==0 || nr==1);
  SoRotor * copiedslave = nr ? (SoRotor *)slavelist[0]->getContainer() : NULL;

  printf("copiedrotor==%p, copiedmaster==%p, copiedslave==%p\n",
         copiedrotor, copiedmaster, copiedslave);

  return 0;
}
-----8<------ [snip] ------------8<------ [snip] -------

    In addition to an error with the slave, which has been mentioned
    in bug #090, there is another error with our copy functionality:
    SGI Inventor copies the master engine we're connected to, while we
    only copy the actual connection back to the same engine.

    A test run:

    Coin:
        rotor==0x807dd70, masterrotor==0x807d510, slaverotor==0x807c990
        copiedrotor==0x807f198, copiedmaster==0x807d510, copiedslave==(nil)

    SGI Inventor:
        rotor==0x8058050, masterrotor==0x8057e58, slaverotor==0x8051940
        copiedrotor==0x80594d8, copiedmaster==0x805a2f0, copiedslave==0x8059628

    (Notice how masterrotor and copiedmaster is the same for Coin,
    while different for SGI Inventor.)

=====================================================================

092 SoToVRMLAction outputs empty scene graph when given a Coin/inventor
    scene graph.

    SoToVRMLAction only supports VRML2 scene graphs, not Coin/inventor
    scene graphs.

=====================================================================

095 SoIndexedTriangleStripSet renders much slower with PER_FACE normals.

    According to pederb, this is not expected, so something fishy is
    going on.

    This is seen on a Linux NVidia box with v41.91 driver and
    GeForce2.

    Here's a model which reproduces the problem. Just load it into the
    examinerviewer:

    pederb has a patch below that "fixes" the problem, but this is not
    a proper fix. Somebody needs to investigate to figure out what is
    really going on. A good start would perhaps be to test on a
    variety of different OpenGL drivers to figure out whether or not
    it is a weakness with NVidia's drivers.

099 View frustum culling is not done unless there are cached bounding
    boxes available.

    E.g. if an app programmer calls setAutoClipping(FALSE) on a
    standard viewer, SoGetBoundingBoxAction will not be invoked each
    frame, and there is no other mechanism in Coin which triggers the
    calculation and storage of bounding boxes.

    This is not a bug, but a performance enhancement suggestion. It
    can have a dramatic effect under certain circumstances.

    pederb suggests this can be solved by letting SoGLRenderAction
    invoke an SoGetBoundingBoxAction on the root node before
    rendering.

    20031211 mortene, reported by pederb.

=====================================================================

100 Wrong use of glGetError().

    According to the glGetError man pages, this function should always
    be called in a loop, until it returns GL_NO_ERROR. This is not
    done everywhere in the Coin source code. Should audit and fix.

    Low priority item, as the consequences of these errors are
    unlikely to be very serious.

    Should perhaps be fixed by making a "cc_glglue_dump_errors()"
    function for the internal OpenGL wrapping?

    20040123 mortene.

=====================================================================

102 Lack of control over OffscreenRenderer context setup

    There is currently no way to enable stencil-buffer and other GL
    features when creating the SoOffscreenRenderer context.  There
    should be a way to control offscreen renderer features in some
    way.  Requested by Josh Flowers.

    20040203 larsa.


    UPDATE 20040203 mortene: my suggestion is that the API should
    present the possibility of setting up a callback weighting
    function to run the available GL-capable contexts through, because
    this will give the API client full control if he/she so wishes.

    Something like this has already been implemented internally for
    SoWin, see SoWinGLWidget::weighPixelFormat(). I.e. default
    weighting algorithms like that function should be available inside
    libCoin, with the option of overriding them through the API.

    Designing the API so it manages to abstract away the peculiarities
    of each window-specific (GLX / WGL / AGL) context struct format
    might be challenging.

=====================================================================

103 Need more 'ivinfo' information

    We should be able to see which version of simage and freetype
    and similar libraries has been detected by Coin.  The simage
    information should also list supported file types / plugin APIs
    in use.  The full path to the actual libraries would also be
    nice to see.  Too often people wonder why textures don't load -
    this would give that answer right away.

    Note: Duplicate bug entry (025) in SoQt/BUGS.txt because this
    must be implemented in cooperation between both libraries.

    20040218 larsa

=====================================================================

104 Unhelpful read error message.

    Trying to load the faulty iv-file below will correctly terminate
    the import operation with an error message, but the error message
    is really lousy:

    --------8<------------- [snip] --------------8<------------- [snip]
    #Inventor V2.1 ascii

    SeparatorKit {
      childList {
        ShapeKit {
          shape Cone{}
        }
      }
    }
    --------8<------------- [snip] --------------8<------------- [snip]

    Results in:

        Coin read error: Expected '}'; got '{'
                Occurred at line   4 in hepp.iv

    ...which just seems wrong, or at least completely unhelpful.

    This is a low priority item.

    Just for reference, the corrected iv-file in this case would look
    something like this:

    --------8<------------- [snip] --------------8<------------- [snip]
    #Inventor V2.1 ascii

105 Reading nested nodekit parts

    Gerhard Reitmayr writes: 
   
    Reading in parts of nested nodekits does not allow certain short
    cuts that are specified by the Inventor Mentor. The Mentor
    specifies on page 278 that within nested nodekits intermediary
    kits can be left out and will be created automatically. Coin does
    not read in this syntax. It also chokes on a related syntax that
    SGI Inventor reads in.

    Example scene graph:

    #Inventor V2.1 ascii

    Separator {
      # Read error in Coin, ok by Mentor
      ShapeKit {
        shape Cube {}
        material Material { diffuseColor 1 0 0 }
      }
      # Read error in Coin, works in SGI
      ShapeKit {
        transform Transform { translation 2 0 0 }
        shape Cube {}
        appearance.material  Material { diffuseColor 0 1 0 }
      }

106 Warning about multiple instances of Coin in SoDB

    In StaticObjectInDLL, we warn (and exit) about multiple coin's
    (both dlls and statically linked!) in the same process image. BUT
    in some cases, having multiple instances of Coin in the same
    process image is perfectly OK - for instance if Coin is used in
    two or more _plugins_ (dlls) to a (usually non-Coin-based)
    application, and Coin is linked statically with these plugins, and
    (!) no Coin-related datastructures are passed between the
    plugins.

    A similar problem would occur if an application loaded a dll using
    coin, then unloaded it, and then loaded it again.

    I have observed this for the Vispo browser (IE) plugin.

    The correct fix is probably to only do the test in
    StaticObjectInDLL for dll versions of Coin.

108 SoVRMLBackground (and SoVRMLImageTexture?) texturing doesn't work
    with SoOffscreenRenderer.

    Most likely because SoVRMLBackground uses an SoVRMLImageTexture,
    which loads textures in the background (if Coin is configured with
    platform-independent mt-support, which is the default). So on the
    first frame, which is what the SoOffscreenRenderer grabs, textures
    will not have completed loading yet.

    Should perhaps best be solved by using a new element
    "SoSynchronizedElement", or some such, which tells traversal
    operations whether or not they are allowed to run in parallel
    threads. SoOffscreenRenderer should then add such an element
    before invoking the SoGLRenderAction.

    20040427 mortene.

=====================================================================

110 SoNodeKitListPart::getChildren()->truncate(0) causes mayhem.

    Reported by Jacob Støren / Fedem. Not surprising this, and there
    are probably other ways that unexpected use of the SoChildList
    returned from the virtual SoNode::getChildren() may cause
    problems. Should audit.

113 SoBlinker import bug.

    The scene graph with the SoBlinker below will not behave as
    expected when read into a viewer: child 1 (the SoCube) should be
    visible, but instead there will be no visible child, which is
    bogus.

-------------8<---------------- [snip] --------------------------
#Inventor V2.1 ascii

Separator {
        Blinker {
                whichChild 1
                on FALSE
                Sphere {}
                Cube {}
                Cylinder {}
        }
}
-------------8<---------------- [snip] --------------------------

    I've investigated a bit, and found that SoBlinker's internal
    SoTimeCounter engine seems to trigger while loading, while the
    SoTimeCounter::min and SoTimeCounter::max fields are set up for no
    children. This will then force whichChild to -1 some time after it
    was set by the readInstance() import code.

    One possible resolution is to override the virtual readInstance()
    and disable the internal SoTimeCounter while reading. This breaks
    the ABI, though, which is uncool while we're on the 2.x branch.

    20040518 mortene.

    UPDATE 20040518 mortene: according to the reported on
    coin-discuss, the same problem can also manifest itself when the
    fields of an SoBlinker is set programmatically. This means the
    readInstance() solution outlined above is not good enough.

=====================================================================

114 VRML-nodes are erroneously renamed upon import.

    VRML-nodes can legally be named in ways which are not ok for
    ordinary Inventor/Coin nodes. They are therefore sometimes renamed
    in error upon import of VRML97-files, from within SoBase::setName().

    I suggest this is fixed within SoBase::setName(), by making the
    code check whether or not the class is internal and has the
    "SoVRML" prefix, and if so; do the Right Thing wrt the VRML97
    spec.

    (BTW, do we have the same problem wrt VRML 1 nodes?)

    According to kintel, this is probably quite a bit of work to do
    properly, one will for instance have to read node names in UTF-8.

    20040521 mortene, bug reported by kintel.

=====================================================================

115 SoBaseKit::setPart() is inefficient.

    When this function is called on a part which was NULL previously,
    a default node on that part is first made, before the part is set
    to the argument to setPart(). This is inefficient and should be
    unnecessary.

    Priority low on this problem, as it shouldn't cause any serious
    harm.

    20040607 mortene, bug reported on coin-discuss by Nikolai Ruhe.

=====================================================================

118 Weakness in internal handling of multiple implicit references to
    the same texture.

    When reading multiple SoTexture2 nodes (and ditto for SoTexture3,
    presumably) referencing the same texture, as in this example:

--------8<------------- [snip] --------------8<------------- [snip]
#Inventor V2.1 ascii

Separator {
  Texture2 { filename "dirt_Mossy.jpg" }
  Cube { }
}
Separator {
  Texture2 { filename "dirt_Mossy.jpg" }
  Cube { }
}
--------8<------------- [snip] --------------8<------------- [snip]

    ...the texture occupies n times the memory it need to do. This is
    a common way to (mis-)layout Inventor and VRML files, so we should
    really fix this so identical textures are shared.

    This should be possible to do by fixing SbImage so it implicitly
    shares the textures "behind the scenes". We then need to implement
    a copy-on-write scheme for when to "split" a texture to two
    instances, as textures can be modified programmatically after
    import.

    I believe I have read in their release notes or other
    documentation that TGS has implemented this for their Inventor
    implementation.

    This is a low-to-medium priority issue.

    20040624 mortene.

=====================================================================

119 Documentation bug: SbBool is not part of the Doxygen-generated
    doc.

    Even though documented in src/misc/SoDB.cpp, documentation for
    SbBool is not generated by Doxygen. This used to work.

    Perhaps the problem is that SbBool is documented as a \class,
    while it should be a \typedef?

    Fool around with Doxygen a bit and find out why it fails, then
    make the necessary changes (to the SbBool doc block in SoDB.cpp,
    probably).

    This is a low priority issue.

120 @exec_prefix@ expansion in Coin/coin.cfg.in makes installed
    package not movable.

    Note that simply replacing with

      exec_prefix="${prefix}"

    is not the correct fix either, as an "exec_prefix" different from
    "prefix" can be set by a configure option.

    The correct solution may be to replace @exec_prefix@ with a new
    variable name (e.g. "@cfg_exec_prefix@"), then expand this to
    either "$prefix" or an absolute path, depending on how configure
    was invoked. If the latter (absolute path), warn the user at the
    end of the configure run that the installation is not movable (and
    explain why this is so)

    That's the best I can think of.

    This is a low priority issue.

    20040705 mortene.

=====================================================================

121 SoOffscreenRenderer tiled rendering causes problems with
    subsequent viewport changes.

    The SmallChange ViewportRegion node sets up a sub-viewport
    according to the SoGLRenderAction's viewport settings, and does
    not know about whether or not the current rendering is part of a
    tiled rendering. This causes artifacts for the commonly used
    "sub-viewport + orthocam + scene graph" trick for rendering
    overlay graphics.

    This needs to be fixed partly in Coin (there is now no mechanism
    for passing on information about whether or not we're doing tiled
    rendering), and partly in SmallChange (ViewportRegion must set up
    the sub-viewport according to the current tile).

    As for the Coin part, this could perhaps best be solved by using a
    new element "SoViewportTileElement", or some such, which should
    contain information about tilesize (absolute and
    relative). SoOffscreenRenderer should then add such an element
    to the state stack before invoking the SoGLRenderAction.

    This is a tricky issue, of fairly low priority.

122 Reading of nested nodekit parts fails.

    As reported by Gerhard Reitmayr <reitmayr@ims.tuwien.ac.at>:

        Reading in parts of nested nodekits does not allow certain
        short cuts that are specified by the Inventor Mentor. The
        Mentor specifies on page 278 that within nested nodekits
        intermediary kits can be left out and will be created
        automatically. Coin does not read in this syntax. It also
        chokes on a related syntax that SGI Inventor reads in.

    Two examples which fails:

--------8<------------- [snip] --------------8<------------- [snip]
#Inventor V2.1 ascii

Separator {
     # Read error in Coin, ok by Mentor
     SoShapeKit {
         shape Cube {}
         material  Material { diffuseColor 1 0 0 }
     }
     # Read error in Coin, works in SGI
     SoShapeKit {
         transform Transform { translation 2 0 0 }
         shape Cube {}
         appearance.material  Material { diffuseColor 0 1 0 }
     }
}
--------8<------------- [snip] --------------8<------------- [snip]

    This is a medium priority item.

123 coin-config --setup uses hardcoded LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable name
    and is incompatible with e.g. tcsh

    Not all platforms uses LD_LIBRARY_PATH for specifying the path
    to dynamically loaded libraries.
    It also uses bash-style assignment of variables.

    This bug also exists for other projects using --setup.

124 Manipulators and Spacemouse support

    When a manipulator receives a SoSpaceballButtonEvent::PICK event,
    it should check if it has been picked and activate itself, staring
    to listen for and react to spaceball events (SoLocation3Event and
    SoSpaceballButtonEvent).

125 Dragger writing is incorrect.

    When writing the SoCenterballDragger, all its parts are written,
    even though they default values. Compare with SGI Inventor, which
    just writes as "CenterballDragger { }", as expected.

    This little test example demonstrates the bug:

--------8<------------- [snip] --------------8<------------- [snip]
#include <Inventor/SoDB.h>
#include <Inventor/SoInteraction.h>
#include <Inventor/nodekits/SoNodeKit.h>
#include <Inventor/draggers/SoCenterballDragger.h>
#include <Inventor/actions/SoWriteAction.h>

int
main(void)
{
  SoDB::init();
  SoNodeKit::init();
  SoInteraction::init();

  SoCenterballDragger * d = new SoCenterballDragger;
  d->ref();

  SoWriteAction w;
  w.apply(d);

  d->unref();
  return 0;
}
--------8<------------- [snip] --------------8<------------- [snip]

    I only tested this for the SoCenterballDragger, but I would expect
    the same problem to at least be present for other draggers, and it
    is most likely a fundamental problem with write actions for
    nodekits.

    This is a medium priority bug.

126 Coin will crash latest NVIDIA drivers with certain valid scene

    The following scene graph will crash in the OpenGL NVIDIA driver
    version 61.76 and 61.77 (which is the most recent, as of this
    writing, released just a few hours ago), when run in the

    It first comes up ok, but click and drag, and it will crash on
    WinXP with the above mentioned driver versions. The same bug has
    also been confirmed to be present for driver version 56.64,
    although the particular variant of the scene graph given above
    might need a bit of massaging to cause a crash.

    This iv-file has 3 Texture2 nodes, 4 IndexedFaceSet nodes, and a
    few additional appearance nodes. Any attempt to reduce the file to
    anything less causes the bug to go away.

    A trace of the GL commands shows that the crash happens when the
    first attempt at running a GL display list (with textures etc in
    it, I presume) is done. Here is the full GL command trace (from
    the GLIntercept tool):

    This is really, really, ugly, and need to be fixed ASAP. It should
    have high priority. NVIDIA cards are widespread, and many users of
    Coin (and users' users) can be hit by this.

    (It seems a complete mystery to me how this bug can have survived
    over several driver releases from NVIDIA, at least since 56.64
    (released 2004-03-??) to 61.77 (released 2004-07-27). What is so
    special about what we do with GL to render the above scene graph?)

    The best solution would be to find a decent work-around, but I
    have failed to come up with something we could do in that regard
    (I tried changing the glColor4ub() calls which seems to have a
    prominent part of the problem into other glColor*() variants, but
    to no avail). Setting the envvar IV_SEPARATOR_MAX_CACHES=0 to turn
    off GL display list generation seems to mostly work, although I
    believe I have seen a case where the bug still came up.

    We should anyway also provide NVIDIA with a minimal example
    (preferably in solely Win32+wgl+gl or GLUT+gl) for them to use for
    reproduction and fixing the bug. Reproducing the bug in such an
    environment should hopefully be doable given the above GL command
    trace (which seems to be quite straightforward to convert to
    working C code).

    20040728 mortene, bug reported by Eivind Rovik.

    UPDATE 20040802 mortene: wrote a minimal example, using only GL
    and GLUT, see

      Coin/docs/driver-bugs/2004-08-02--nvidia-v61.77.cpp

    Not yet sent to NVIDIA, awaiting confirmation from more systems
    than just our own niord.trh.sim.no

128 Worse performance in more recent Coin versions?

    Hannes Kaufmann reports that recent Coin versions seem to have
    worse performance:

    --------8<------------- [snip] --------------8<------------- [snip]

    I am using a Quadro4 900XGL and within our Studierstube framework
    we currently still use Qt 3.0.3 under windows.

    No matter which NVidia driver I use, I always get pretty much the
    same result.  With a Coin version from early this year (February,
    March) I get a 25% higher frame rate (sometimes even more) than
    with versions from late June/July.  I am running exactly the same
    application with exactly the same setup. I just rename folders to
    enable one or another coin version. There can be no flaw in my
    test setup, I always run exactly the same and only exchange coin
    versions (plus simage plus soqt) and nothing else.

    On my machine COIN_ENABLE_VBO is set to 1 as well as
    COIN_USE_GL_VERTEX_ARRAYS (I think these features were already
    implemented in February and are supported by both versions that
    I'm testing)

    This problem is not application specific. I see the same drop of
    framerate with other applications and on other machines.

    --------8<------------- [snip] --------------8<------------- [snip]

    I've suggested to try turning off those envvars (VBOs and vertex
    arrays are known to cause worse performance with certain drivers /
    cards), and upgrade his version of SoQt (pederb recently fixed a
    problem with idle processing and Qt timers). Currently awaiting
    reply.
