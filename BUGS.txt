003 There are seams in texturemaps on SGI Octane with "IMPACTSR"
    graphics hardware.

    Can at least be seen on the SoGuiExamples/nodes/texture
    example. Reported by Dan Stewart on coin-discuss. Cause not yet
    known. Hard to debug and fix without access to the platform in
    question.

005 Free memory read on connected SoSFEnum fields?

    This is an old problem which might have been fixed now, but we
    should check it with Valgrind: Purify used to report "Free memory
    read" when deleting SoSFEnum fields that were connected to other
    fields.

    (Original test-code supplied by Nigel Murry.)

    Some other specifications for nurbscurves and nurbssurfaces tested
    works correctly.

    pederb has tracked this down to be likely to be caused by bugs in
    libGLU: a rendered curve is different from a tesselated curve (!).

    Hard to solve this *properly* without implementing our own
    nurbs-library, thereby dropping GLU. Are there any quick-fixes we
    could apply?

=====================================================================

012 Buglet: the SoMaterial::shininess field is not clamped if it's >
    1.0. This causes OpenGL errors, at least with some drivers.

    (The other material field values are also likely to be able to
    cause problems like this.)

    Consider this bug a low priority item.

=====================================================================

017 If you drag one of the interaction tabs on an SoTabPlaneDragger
    past the one on the opposite side (that is: so the scaleFactor in
    that direction is close to 0.0), I can see 2 problems which are
    both probably related to the same bug:

        - the geometry "oscillates" around origo as long as the drag
          operation is held

        - if one releases the drag in this position, it's impossible
          to grab one of the tabs again (and the geometry is placed
          wrongly, use "View All" in an examiner viewer to see this)

    For convenience, here's the (trivial) scenegraph one can use to
    reproduce the problem in any viewer component:

    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---
    #Inventor V2.1 ascii

    TabPlaneDragger { }
    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---

    I *guess* this should be fixed by placing some lower bound on the
    scalevector values, that somehow matches the lower reaches of
    floating point accuracy that we can still safely use without
    getting the artifacts mentioned above.

=====================================================================

018 SoTransformerDragger has a bug where the transformation matrix can
    end up with shearing.

    Here's a simple way of reproducing the bug: click and drag the
    middle front rotation point after loading the following scene (and
    changing the viewpoint slightly, so the camera direction is not
    normal to it). Upon releasing the rotation invokation, the
    geometry of the Text3 will be slightly sheared, indicating a
    faulty transform matrix somewhere:

    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---
    #Inventor V2.1 ascii

    Separator {
       TransformerManip { }
       Text3 { string "b"   parts ALL }
    }
    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---

    The bug is also listed in the topmost FIXME in
    src/draggers/SoTransformerDragger.cpp, so update that comment
    aswell if you fix the problem.

    mortene 20020813.

=====================================================================

019 When using the CTRL key while doing scaling with
    SoTransformerDragger (to scale against the corner point on the
    opposite side), the geometry will jump by an offset both on
    pushing and releasing the CTRL key.

    For convenience, here's a (trivial) scenegraph to reproduce the
    problem:

    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---
    #Inventor V2.1 ascii

    Separator {
       TransformerManip { }
       Text3 { string "b"   parts ALL }
    }
    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---

    This bug basically renders the "CTRL-scaling" feature unusable.

    The bug is also listed in a FIXME near the top in
    src/draggers/SoTransformerDragger.cpp, so update that comment
    aswell if you fix the problem.

020 There is a crash bug when changing the parts of an
    SoTransformBoxDragger. It can be reproduced with this stand-alone
    example:

    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---
    #include <Inventor/Qt/SoQt.h>
    #include <Inventor/Qt/viewers/SoQtExaminerViewer.h>

    #include <Inventor/nodes/SoSeparator.h>


    int
    main(int argc, char ** argv)
    {
      QWidget * window = SoQt::init(argv[0]);

      SoTransformBoxDragger * dragger = new SoTransformBoxDragger;

      SbString str;
      for (int i = 1; i <= 6; i++) {
        str.sprintf("translator%d.translator", i);
        dragger->setPart(str.getString(), new SoSeparator);
      }

      SoQtExaminerViewer * viewer = new SoQtExaminerViewer(window);
      viewer->setSceneGraph(dragger);
      viewer->show();
      SoQt::show(window);

      SoQt::mainLoop();

      delete viewer;
      return 0;
    }
    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---

    The bugs pop up at application *exit*, but not every time -- you
    will typically have to try 4 or 5 times to get it to bug out.

    Here's the backtrace from the first indication that something is
    wrong (ie the first SoDebugError posting):

    UPDATE 20021010 mortene: pederb fixed a bug that seems to be
    caused by the same error as this one. The bug was never really
    *understood*, though, which seems dangerous.. see the FIXME code
    comment in SoChildList::remove().

    UPDATE 20021014 rolvs: I tried to reintroduce the bug by undoing
    the change done by pederb as described in SoChildList::remove()
    FIXME. I was not able to reproduce the described effect. I'm
    investigating this further, as there seem to be some gravel in the
    list-machinery. (See FIXME in SoChildList::insert)

    UPDATE 20021209 rolvs: Consider this fixed and remove from BUGS?
    (Still unable to reproduce)

=====================================================================
025 Import hangs on invalid scenegraph. This reproduces the problem:

    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---
    #VRML V2.0 utf8
    
    Group {
       children [
          *
       ]
    }
    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---

    The '*' character can be replaced by any character not valid in
    identifier names, and the bug will still be present.

    Should of course never hang, but rather spit out an error message
    and abort the import process.

=====================================================================

026 Bounding box calculation: the bbox for the Barcelona.iv model is
    _very_ sub-optimal. (SGI Inventor seems to make a perfect fit.)

    Update, some further investigations made: the bug disappears if we
    remove the invalid face (there are two "-1" in a row in the
    coordIndex field). Bbox-calculation code should match the
    rendering code in what action to take when detecting this case, so
    bboxes matches the geometry that actually gets rendered.

=====================================================================

028 So[SM]FString I/O problem
    " characters in strings aren't backslash-quoted when exported to
    file.  This causes the fields to get another value when it is
    read in again.

    This indicates that there is a general problem with not backslash-
    quoting string characters that need quoting, or maybe octal
    representation (if that is a valid string character representation).

    Related to this, the string reader doesn't jump in and out of
    quoted-string-mode when it encounters unquoted "-characters that
    open or close strings in the middle of the string.  I'm not sure
    if what's the correct behaviour is specified in any file format
    specification though - maybe the VRML1/VRML97 specs?.  If not,
    SGI Inventor would serve as the reference implementation on this
    issue.

    SoAsciiText * text = new SoAsciiText;
    text->string.set1Value(0, "\"quoted string\"");
    writeaction.apply(text);

    When read in again, this is read in as the two strings "quoted" and
    "string\"\"," - the last , coming from the multi-field separator,
    I guess.

    I would expect the last to be just "string" if the quoted-string-mode
    switching worked like in the Bourne shell where you can write
    h""ey" yo"u to produce the string "hey you".  The C string syntax
    would perhaps be more natural to compare with - there this kind of
    stuff isn't allowed at all.
    
    20020923 larsa.

    UPDATE 20030709 larsa: changes has been made wrt handling of
    double-quotes and backslashes a while ago, and I believe this
    problem has been fixed now.

=====================================================================

029 SoSFEnum / SoMFEnum / SoSFBitMask / SoMFBitMask can't be used for
    SoUnknownNode. The following will not import properly in Coin, but
    rather elicit a read error message:

    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---
    #Inventor V2.1 ascii
    
    MarkerKit {
       fields [ SFEnum outerShape ]
       outerShape 0
    }
    ----8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---------8<--- [snip] ---

    The error message is:

        Coin read error: no mappings available for SoSFEnum field
        outerShape

    The reason for this problem is that the import code expects to use
    an SoSFEnum field that has been set up with a full set of enum
    values <-> names mappings. This is not the case for SoUnknownNode
    fields.

    What should be done about this is probably to be more "slack"
    about allowing SoSFEnum et al to be used _without_ name mappings
    (at least in certain contexts).

    Consider this bug a low priority item.

030 Running larsa's 'iv2scenegraph' tool (from SmallChange/test-code/)
    on the good old windmill.iv model (and probably others aswell)
    makes it output a PNG that is "skewed".

    Most likely an SoOffscreenRenderer bug (perhaps with the unlimited
    buffer size functionality), but more investigation is needed.

    20020924 mortene.

    UPDATE 20021121 larsa:  I think Øystein has fixed the skewing
    problem now - don't know if he has been instructed to update this
    file when fixing bugs?  Anyways, he has other problems with the
    offscreen renderer he is working on.

=====================================================================

031 Setting up the alpha channel for the offscreen renderer doesn't
    consistently (between hosts) produce a transparent background when
    using setComponents(SoOffscreenRenderer::RGB_TRANSPARENCY).  It
    works at home on my Debian Linux w/ GeForce4MX440 with the 3123
    NVIDIA GLX sources, but not at work with whatever gfx system I
    have there.

    UPDATE 20020927 mortene: this could simply be caused by the GLX /
    X11 drivers lacking support for any alpha-enabled visuals
    (according to spec, it is not guaranteed that any such visual is
    available). Anyway, the right way to solve this problem is to 1)
    write our own weight-function for X11 visuals (like it's been done
    for MSWin visuals in SoWin's SoWinGLWidget.cpp), for better
    control of the selection process. Then 2) warn the user if we
    can't get hold of any visual capable of all requested features.

    UPDATE 20021022 larsa: this was the case - old XFree3 with old
    Mesa does not support alpha for offscreen rendering.

    UPDATE 20021121 larsa: The offscreen renderer GL context creation
    is nevertheless bogus (with GLX at least), and should be fixed so
    the best possible context is created.

032 The following lineset will render in SGI Inventor, but asserts
    in Coin (don't know what happens in non-debug builds).

    #Inventor V2.1 ascii

    Separator {
      Coordinate3 {
        point [ 0 0 0, 1 0 0, 2 0 0, 3 0 0 ]

          -1, # the offending empty line segment

        ]
      }

    run-time by the robust rendering method.

    UPDATE 20021010 mortene: fixed now?
    
=====================================================================

033 Some of the default geometry files for dragger geometries uses an
    SoDrawStyle::lineWidth > 1.0. This can be outside the legal range
    of the OpenGL implementation, which only guarantees that 1.0 can
    be used. (We have indeed received at least one problem report due
    to this.)

    I'm working on a solution for this, which involves setting up some
    new global fields which contains the legal ranges of glLineWidth()
    and glPointSize(). From .iv-files, one can then connect to these
    global fields.

036 This program will hit an assert if we interact with the
    SoTrackballDragger at the same time as it is removed from the

    Should of course be robust and handle this properly without
    crashing, even though this is a rather obscure problem.

    (Consider this bug a low-priority item.)

    I did some quick checking on a few other draggers, and they seem
    to handle getting destructed while they are interacted
    with. Should check all of them after fixing this
    SoTrackballDragger bug, though.

    exact cause of why this is found to be problematic.

    Using circular connections for fields is pretty obscure, so

043 We're writing invalid VRML97 files.

    According to spec, '+' is not allowed as a first character of
    nodes names in VRML97. But upon writing a scene graph from Coin,
    nameless nodes that are referenced from other nodes is still
    written to disk as "DEF +0", "DEF +1", etc.

    For how to fix properly, see Coin/docs/todo.txt, item #003.

    20021029 mortene, problem reported by kintel.

=====================================================================

044 Release builds on Cygwin/MSVC++ doesn't heed all configure
    options.

    Specifically, "--disable-symbols" should remove the "/Zi" option
    to cl.exe, and "--enable-optimization" should add "/O2" (or some
    such).

    20021118 mortene, problem reported by Michael Wimmer on
    coin-discuss.

    20021118 larsa - the --disable-symbols problem is fixed, and I'm
    against adding "--enable-optimization".  The users should rather
    specify the optimization options they want in CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS.

    20021121 larsa: since Autoconf automatically adds -O2, we should
    consider adding an option to remove that option, if it can be
    made to work without touching user-set CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS and only
    the autoconf-set optimization-options.  Tricky stuff...

045 SoCenterballManip rotation off-center.

    When dragging the 'stripes' on a CenterballManip node, rotation
    happen around an off-center axis. (Off CenterballManip center)

    NOTE: The bug is not visible if there is no connected geometry, or
    if the geometry is 'simple', like one cube or one cone.

    UPDATE 20030408 mortene: there is also a second bug here; the
    scene bounding box is not calculated correctly, as can be seen by
    loading this into e.g. the ExaminerViewer. The near clip plane
    will clip part of the manip's geometry, something which should
    never happen.

    3D-texturing on a non-3D-texture capable platform (for instance on
    remote/indirect rendering -- see code comments near top of
    Coin/src/glue/gl.c) causes weird errors, like 3D-textures being
    rescaled to 0x0x1.

    The rescaling happens from within SoGLImage.cpp, but attempts at
    3D-texturing should be checked versus driver capabilities much
    earlier (in SoTexture3, perhaps?) so that the rescaling code never
    gets executed.

    If 3D-textures are attempted used but are not available, there
    should be an *elaborate* SoDebugError::postWarning() that explains
    why.

047 SoAntiSquish seems to trigger a bug in our matrix factoring code.

    From a coin-discuss posting by Philippe Debanné:

    ----8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] --      
    
    I am planning to design my own Dragger class and have been looking
    at the Toolmaker Ch. 8 examples: TranslateRadialDragger and
    RotTransDragger.  I found an unexpected behaviour of
    RotTransDragger (top-left of scene): When dragging one of the
    SoRotateCylindricalDraggers, the dragger will switch from rotation
    to scaling up as the mouse position approaches and goes beyond the
    bounding cylinder of the (spherical) dragger.  In fact, the
    dragger should not do any scaling up/down!! This happens
    systematically when dragging the horizontal band left or right
    (Y-axis rotation).

    When I comment out the SoAntiSquish part of RotTransDragger, this
    unexpected behaviour dissapears (But obviously you want the
    AntiSquish's anti-squishing behaviour!).  Alternately, if I set
    its 'recalcAlways' field to FALSE, I get a different strange
    behaviour: manipulation of the RotTransDragger affects the
    rendering of the RotTransManip to the right of it: its
    antisquishing scaling factor and fluctuations of its wire-mesh
    sphere.  All this seems to be independant of the AntiSquish
    'sizing' field, e.g.  BIGGEST_DIMENSION or LONGEST_DIAGONAL.

    ----8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] --      

    pederb has investigated, and found that this seems likely to be a
    problem with our SbMatrix code that factors the translation,
    scaling and rotation out of a matrix.

048 Building SGI InventorXt on top of Coin reveals compile-time
    incompabilities.

    A Coin user reported two problems on coin-discuss:

        - InventorXt uses an Inventor-internal include file:
          Inventor/SoDebug.h. This contains a set of static debugging
          helper methods. They seem easy enough to implement, so
          perhaps we should do that.

        - Some explicit inclusion of SbTime.h is needed with Coin,
          that is not necessary with SGI Inventor. This is an
          incompatibility that we would like to get rid of, to make
          porting _other_ code from SGI Inventor to Coin a literal
          no-brainer.

051 ExaminerViewer's automatic initial "view all" doesn't work on
    a scene graph with SoImage.

    Reproduce with the following source code snippet. The
    "aass_logo.rgb" is an image of dimensions 80x68 (I haven't
    investigated if this matters or not).

    ----8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] --      
    #include <Inventor/Qt/SoQt.h>
    #include <Inventor/Qt/viewers/SoQtExaminerViewer.h>
    #include <Inventor/nodes/SoSeparator.h>
    #include <Inventor/nodes/SoImage.h>
    #include <Inventor/nodes/SoCone.h>
        
    int
    main(int argc, char* argv[])
    {
      QWidget * mainwin = SoQt::init(argv[0]);
    
      SoSeparator * root = new SoSeparator;
      root->ref();
    
      root->addChild(new SoCone);
    
      SoImage * img = new SoImage;
      root->addChild(img);
      img->filename = "aass_logo.rgb";
    
      SoQtExaminerViewer * viewer = new SoQtExaminerViewer(mainwin);
      viewer->setSceneGraph(root);
        
      SoQt::show(mainwin);
      SoQt::mainLoop();
    
      delete viewer;
      root->unref();
        
      return 0;
    }
    ----8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] --      

    Notice how the cone is a tiny dot in the lower left corner of the
    image at first. Then click view all (the eye icon) and see how the
    camera is then positioned where it should be. Correct behavior
    would be for the camera to be positioned there from the start.

    20030103 mortene.

    WONTFIX? 20030225 rolvs: In this example, setSceneGraph calls
    viewAll() before the window is 'show'-ed. The viewport region
    passed to (*SoCamera)->viewAll( graph, vpreg ) is therefore wrong,
    causing a malformed boundingbox for the image and thus a malformed
    view.

    UPDATE 20030225 mortene: is there any simple and clean way to
    detect and handle this with a) a warning message for the app
    programmer, b) using a decent "dummy" / default region?

052 MSWin dependency walker gives surprising results.

    We have a report that Coin and SoQt configure with

054 SoComputeBoundingBox engine probably fails with viewport-dependent
    geometry.

    The SoGuiExamples/engines/computexfbbox example fails with a small
    scene with an SoText2 in it:

    Cube { }

    Text2 { string [ "hepp", "tjo-bing", "hupp" ] }
    ----8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] --      

    ..and pederb tracked this down to a failure of the engine's
    evaluate() to be called again when the camera position changes.

    Note that this bug is probably rather hard to fix properly.

    axis, the position will be reported as <x, 0, 1.0>. That z=1.0 is

059 VRML97 file crashes Coin.

    Group {
      children
    }  
    ----8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] --      

    Partly tracked down: there is something fishy about how we handle
    empty group nodes -- it seems like a NULL pointer get added to the
    SoMFNode field. It might be two bugs here: *no* children should be
    set up (instead of the single NULL child), and NULL child pointers
    should _probably_ not be allowed by SoMFNode.

    UPDATE: pederb checked with the VRML97 grammar, and according to
    that, only SoSFNode fields are allowed to store NULL pointers.

    UPDATE: kintel also had a related bug report. This file:

    ----8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] ---------8<---- [snip] --

      This is a special case as it is already a VRML2 file. However, I

      with mixed scene graphs and want to convert them to VRML2."

    Coin-2/src/base/SbBox3f.cpp:263: void SbBox3f::setBounds (const SbVec3f
    &, const SbVec3f &): Assertion `0' failed.

    FIX: The correct thing to do is to track downwards to the "uppermost"
    place in the call-stack where whatever causes this error condition is 
    still an _invalid_ condition. Then go one more step down and catch the 
    problem there (by spitting out a warning and otherwise handle the 
    condition gracefully (don't crash or assert)).

065 libtool.m4 needs upgrading

    http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=190223

    The current version we use doesn't support MIPS shared libs.
    The current version of libtool.m4 contains some Coin-specific
    tweaks though (Mac OS X stuff amongst others) that we need to
    inspect and check if are still needed before replacing libtool.m4

    20030424 larsa. Reported through Steve Robbins by Ryan Murray.

    Update 20030424 kyrah: AFAIK, only the convenience library hack
    [http://sim.no/~kyrah/patches/20021217_libtool.patch] in ltmain.sh
    is necessary for Mac OS X - at least that was the only thing I had
    to change for Coin-2. This is a known libtool problem, and is
    fixed in libtool-1.4.3 and libtool-1.5, according to Fink

    model is outside the view.

    To reproduce:

    o Open model in an examiner viewer.
    o Resize the window so height ~= 2* width.
    o Rotate the model so you get minimal total height in the view.
    o Press viewall. If my problems doesn't show, rotate around the up
      axis and press viewall repeatedly until error occurs.

    I tried the model in the SoGuiExamples/engines/computexfbbox
    example, and the bounding box gets calculated correctly. I guess
    that means there's a bug in either SoCamera::viewAll() or in
    SoGuiViewer::viewAll() -- most likely the latter.

    SoMFNode::fixCopy).  It complains that the "copiedinstancestack"
    hasn't been created. (line 735)
    
    Now, looking at the code, it appears that the copiedinstancestack
    and friends only get created by a call from SoNode::copy, not
    SoNode::copyContents.  Is this a bug in Coin or ivperf?
    
    I had a brief look through the SGI Inventor source, and it appears
    that their findCopy would return NULL if the dictionary hadn't
    been created. Is this the correct behaviour?

    --------------8<----------- [snip] ------------------8<--------

    We should probably match the semantics of SoNode::copyContents()
    in SGI Inventor 100% -- that is, _unless_ the "return NULL"
    strategy is just a stupid robustness bug work-around in SGI
    Inventor.

    Investigate.

072 Assert failure when writing extension nodekit in binary format.

    Running the example program below causes the following assert to
    hit:

      test: /home/sigma/mortene/code/coin-head/src/misc/SoBase.cpp:248: void set_current_writeref(const SoBase *, int): Assertion `rc >= 0 && "buggy writerefcounter"' failed.
      Aborted

    This points at some very nasty error, where some part of the scene
    graph is not tagged for writing on the first SoWriteAction pass,
    but is still attempted written on the second pass.

    It's really lame that we have this kind of bug at all, as having
    the two passes traverse the same structures shouldn't be rocket
    science.

    When writing as ASCII, the assert does *not* hit -- which means
    traversal is different somewhere for binary and ascii export.

073 Multiple complexity settings for same SoTexture2 does not work.

    Using the same SoTexture2 nodes with different
    SoComplexity::textureQuality settings is something which works for
    SGI Inventor, so it should be considered a Coin bug.

    Reproducible problem, example file:

    --------------8<----------- [snip] ------------------8<--------
    #Inventor V2.1 ascii
    
    Separator {
       Separator {
          Complexity { textureQuality 0.1 }
    
          DEF mytex Texture2 {
             image 2 2 3
             0xffffff 0x00ff00   # white   green
             0xff0000 0xffff00   #  red    yellow
          }
    
          Cube { }
       }
    
       Separator {
          Complexity { textureQuality 1.0 }
          USE mytex
          Translation { translation 5 0 0 }
          Cube { }
       }
    }

    pederb's comments on the bug:

        We handled this earlier, but when adding proper support for
        auto-caching, it was easier to store everything for a texture
        object inside the texture object, and then identify it with a
        single uint32. Then it's quite easy to figure out the current
        texture object after a display list has been executed (the
        render-cache must store the OpenGL state changes it does so
        that SoGLLazyElement is updated after the display list has
        been executed). I could add additional variables for storing
        the filter settings, but I just couldn't see any practical
        reason for doing this.

074 SoComplexity::textureQuality changes must be made before
    SoTexture2 traversal.

    In the "Inventor spirit" of appearance settings not having any
    effect until hitting a shape node, it should be possible to do
    this:

    --------------8<----------- [snip] ------------------8<--------
    #Inventor V2.1 ascii
    
    Separator {
      Texture2 {
         image 2 2 3
         0xffffff 0x00ff00   # white   green
         0xff0000 0xffff00   #  red    yellow
      }
    
      Complexity { textureQuality 0 }

      Cube { }
    }
    --------------8<----------- [snip] ------------------8<--------

    ..but the SoComplexity node will have no effect in this case. I
    feel it should.

    Note that SGI Inventor doesn't handle this either, but I still
    think it is a weakness in Coin which we should fix.

075 SoHandleBoxManip does not behave correctly when locking a
    translation axis.

    To reproduce, load this simple iv-file into an examinerviewer:

    --------------8<----------- [snip] ------------------8<--------
    #Inventor V2.1 ascii

    HandleBoxManip { }
    --------------8<----------- [snip] ------------------8<--------

    ..then hold down SHIFT while LMB-clicking on one of the sides (for
    translation). The translation will correctly be locked to one
    axis, but when releasing the SHIFT button, the manip will jump to
    the current cursor location. This last behavior is incorrect.

=====================================================================

076 SoHandleBoxManip does not behave well upon "deep Z translation".

    To reproduce, load this simple iv-file into an examinerviewer:

    --------------8<----------- [snip] ------------------8<--------
    #Inventor V2.1 ascii

    HandleBoxManip { }
    --------------8<----------- [snip] ------------------8<--------

    ..then move the box out to the left side of the view
    (i.e. translate in -X), before LMB-clicking the right side of the
    box to translate in the Z direction. The manip will correctly move
    in the Z direction when moving the mouse cursor to the right, but
    upon continuing moving the mouse cursor to the right it suddenly
    misbehaves by first jumping back close to the camera, and then
    starting to move in the *negative* Z direction.

    This is clearly bad handling of some kind of border case.
