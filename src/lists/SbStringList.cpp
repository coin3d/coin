  \class SbStringList SbStringList.h Inventor/lists/SbStringList.h
  \brief The SbStringList class is a container for arrays of SbString pointers.
  \ingroup base

  Note that upon using the equality and inequality operators, the
  strings themselves are not compared, only the pointer values.

  \sa SbList
*/


/*!
  \fn SbStringList::SbStringList(void)

  Default constructor.
*/

/*!
  \fn SbStringList::SbStringList(const int sizehint)

  This constructor initializes the internal allocated size for the
  list to \a sizehint. Note that the list will still initially contain
  zero items.

  \sa SbList::SbList(const int sizehint)
*/

/*!
  \fn SbStringList::SbStringList(const SbStringList & l)

  Copy constructor.

  \sa SbList::SbList(const SbList<Type> & l)
*/

/*!
  \fn SbString * SbStringList::get(const int index) const

  This method returns the element at \a index. Does the same thing as
  SbList::operator[](). This method is only present for compatibility
  with the original Inventor API.
*/

/*!
  \fn void SbStringList::set(const int index, SbString * const item)

  This method sets the element at \a index to \a item. Does the same
  thing as SbList::operator[](). This method is only present for
  compatibility with the original Inventor API.
