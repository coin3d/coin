  \class SoMotion3Event SoMotion3Event.h Inventor/events/SoMotion3Event.h
  \brief The SoMotion3Event class contains information about 3D movement
  events.
  \ingroup events

  Motion3 events are generated by devices capable of "3D motion", for
  instance spaceballs. Instances of this class contains information about
  these devices' translations and rotations in all 3 dimensions.
