  \brief The SoLockManager is a defunct software license lock mechanism.

  \ingroup coin_general

  This is just a dummy implementation of the TGS Inventor class used
  to provide a license locking mechanism. Since Coin can be used
  without any royalty fees or client-site license locks, no such
  mechanism is needed.

  If you are looking for information about using Coin in proprietary
  applications for commercial distribution, read about the Coin
  Professional Edition License on the Coin web-pages <a
  href="http://coin3d.github.io">here</a>.
