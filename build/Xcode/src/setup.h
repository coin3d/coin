 *
 * The scene profiling module contains some texture data that for now
 * adds a significant chunk to the Coin library size, so we felt it was best
 * to make application developers be able to disable this if binary size is
 * important to their project.  The size-argument is hopefully just a
 * temporary one, but we might make it possible to disable this feature
 * anyway after that problem has been fixed.
