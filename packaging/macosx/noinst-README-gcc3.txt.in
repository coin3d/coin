This is Coin-@VERSION@ by Kongsberg Oil & Gas Technologies.
What you have downloaded is only the framework itself, provided as a
convenience for those who do not want to use binary installers. To
install, simply drag the Inventor.framework to /Library/Frameworks. If
you prefer, you can also find a complete package including an
installer and the Coin commandline tools on our ftp server[0].

Note that this binary SDK has been built with gcc 3.3, meaning that no
earlier version of gcc should be used in combination with this
framework. The framework is, however, built with
MACOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.2 to be deployable on 10.2 (Jaguar) or
later versions of Mac OS X.

The Coin3D/Mac homepage[2] contains more information on how to get
started using Coin. You might also want to consider joining our public
mailing list for discussions related to Coin3D development[3].

Enjoy!
