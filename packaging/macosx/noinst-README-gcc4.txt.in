This is Coin-@VERSION@ by Kongsberg Oil & Gas Technologies.
What you have downloaded is only the framework itself, provided as a
convenience for those who do not want to use binary installers. To
install, simply drag the Inventor.framework to /Library/Frameworks. If
you prefer, you can also find a complete package including an
installer and the Coin commandline tools on our ftp server[0].

Note that this binary SDK has been built with gcc 4.0, meaning that no
earlier version of gcc should be used in combination with this
framework. Due to the ABI changes in gcc 4.0, applications built
against this framework can only be used on Mac OS 10.4 "Tiger" or Mac
OS 10.3.9. If you need to deploy on earlier versions of Mac OS X, use
gcc 3.3 and the binary SDK of Coin built with gcc 3.3. For more
information, please read the relevant FAQ entry at [1].

The Coin3D/Mac homepage[2] contains more information on how to get
started using Coin. You might also want to consider joining our public
mailing list for discussions related to Coin3D development[3].

Enjoy!
