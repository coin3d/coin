This is Coin-@VERSION@ by Kongsberg Oil & Gas Technologies.
Double-click on Coin.pkg to start the installation. If you intend to
develop without using Xcode, you should also install the CoinTools
package, which contains the coin-config commandline utility, its
associated man page, and its default configuration.

If you do not want to use an installer, you can find a package
containing only the framework itself on our ftp server[0] (look for
Coin-@VERSION@-gcc4-no_inst.dmg).

Note that this binary SDK has been built with gcc 3.3, meaning that no
earlier version of gcc should be used in combination with this
framework. The framework is, however, built with
MACOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.2 to be deployable on 10.2 (Jaguar) or
later versions of Mac OS X.

The Coin3D/Mac homepage[2] contains more information on how to get
started using Coin. You might also want to consider joining our public
mailing list for discussions related to Coin3D development[3].

Enjoy!
