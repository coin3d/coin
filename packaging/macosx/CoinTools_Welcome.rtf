This will install the coin-config commandline utility, its associated man page, and its default configuration. The coin tools are a convenience if you want to build Coin applications from the Terminal, and are also needed when compiling SoQt. If you intend to develop in Xcode only, installing the CoinTools is unnecessary.\
\
To install Coin itself, run the Coin installer.\
