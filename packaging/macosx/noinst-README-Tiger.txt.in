This is Coin-@VERSION@ by Kongsberg Oil & Gas Technologies. What you have
downloaded is only the framework itself, provided as a convienience for those
who do not want to use binary installers. To install, simply drag the
Inventor.framework to /Library/Frameworks.

You can find a complete package including an installer and the Coin
commandline tools at our ftp://ftp.sim.no/pub/coin/bin/macosx.

Note that this binary SDK has been built with gcc 4.0, meaning that 
no earlier version of gcc should be used in combination with this
framework. Due to the ABI changes in gcc 4.0, the framework can only 
be used on Mac OS 10.4 "Tiger". For more information, please read 
the relevant FAQ entry at http://www.coin3d.org/mac/faq/#tiger

Check out http://www.coin3d.org/mac for information on how to get
started using Coin.

Enjoy!
