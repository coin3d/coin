# All text after a hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored
# The format is:

# For lists items can also be appended using:

# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (" ")

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded 
# by quotes) that should identify the project.

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) 
# base path where the generated documentation will be put.

# where doxygen was started. If left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = 

# The OUTPUT_LANGUAGE tag is used to specify the language in which all 
# documentation generated by doxygen is written. Doxygen will use this

STRIP_CODE_COMMENTS    = YES

# If the CASE_SENSE_NAMES tag is set to NO then Doxygen will only generate 
# file names in lower case letters. If set to YES upper case letters are also

# users are adviced to set this option to NO.

CASE_SENSE_NAMES       = YES

# If the SHORT_NAMES tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate much shorter

# of that file.

SHOW_INCLUDE_FILES     = YES

# If the JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF tag is set to YES then Doxygen 
# will interpret the first line (until the first dot) of a JavaDoc-style

# explict @brief command for a brief description.

JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF      = YES

# If the INHERIT_DOCS tag is set to YES (the default) then an undocumented 
# member inherits the documentation from any documented member that it

# will sort the (detailed) documentation of file and class members

# If member grouping is used in the documentation and the DISTRIBUTE_GROUP_DOC

# commands in the documentation.

GENERATE_BUGLIST       = YES

# This tag can be used to specify a number of aliases that acts 
# as commands in the documentation. An alias has the form "name=value". 
# For example adding "sideeffect=\par Side Effects:\n" will allow you to 
# put the command \sideeffect (or @sideeffect) in the documentation, which 
# will result in a user defined paragraph with heading "Side Effects:". 
# You can put \n's in the value part of an alias to insert newlines.

#       * general aliases that may be spread around in the
#         documentation anywhere
