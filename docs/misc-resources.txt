WHAT'S THIS?
============

A collection of useful/interesting links for Coin developers. It can, for 
instance, be resources needed when adding new features to Coin or links to 
techniques for optimizing Coin.

THE LINKS
=========

* com.graphics.algorithms FAQ:
  <URL:http://www.faqs.org/faqs/graphics/algorithms-faq/>

  Somebody should read through it meticulously to see if there are any
  hints which can be used for optimizations or API extensions in Coin,
  or even completely new features.

* Optimized Collision Detection
  2001-05-10 Peder Blekken <pederb@sim.no>
  http://www.codercorner.com/Opcode.htm

  Claims to be much faster than other implementations. Is free to use
  in any commercail or non-commercial program.

  nVIDIA extensions for optimized rendering without using display lists.
  Link has example program, source code and documentation.

  2001-05-18 Peder Blekken <pederb@sim.no>
  http://www.nvidia.com/Marketing/Developer/DevRel.nsf/bookmark/EEFAD0772D0514D288256A4D00662526

  Uses shadow mapping hardware and alpha test. Can be implemented in
  OpenGL using Nvidia extensions for GeForce3.

* GL2PS. A Postscript rendering library.
  2001-06-11 Peder Blekken <pederb@sim.no>

  http://www.geuz.org/gl2ps/

  A library for rendering high quality postscript from any OpenGL
  application. Released under LGPL.

  Update 2002-01-17 mortene: an article explaining how to do
  resolution independent vector export from OpenGL can also be found
  here: <URL:http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/glexport.asp>.

* openNURBS
  2001-07-20 Marius Kintel <kintel@sim.no>

  For higher quality ? NURBS rendering. Nice license:

   - Commercial use is encouraged  
   - The tools, support, and membership are free
   - There are no restrictions. Neither copyright nor copyleft restrictions 
     apply
   - No contribution of effort or technology is required from the members, 
     although it is encouraged

* In-depth explanation of OpenGL on MSWin platforms:

  <URL:http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/>, follow the link to
  "Graphics and multimedia", then "Open GL"

* A shareware VRML browser and general 3D viewer (DXF, RAW, OBJ,
  GLView), which we could take a look at to compare features with our
  soon-to-come (?) VRMLView replacement:

  http://home.snafu.de/hg/

* OpenGL Multipipe SDK

  http://www.sgi.com/software/multipipe/sdk/

  SDK for programming multipipe applications on SGI hardware. Free
  download.

  "Programming With Threads", Kleiman / Shah / Smaalders, ISBN
  0131723898

* Miscellaneous C++ libraries: <URL:http://www.boost.org>. If the
  licenses are liberal, we might be able to avoid re-inventing wheels
  for some of the libraries provided.

* List of API changes from SGI Inventor v2.0 to v2.1:

   <URL:http://wwwinfo.cern.ch/asd/lhc++/OpenInventor/pro/porting/chapter2.html>.

  Contains lots of information about obsoleted features and field
  value limitations that we need to check that we heed.

* Information about the OpenGL ABI:

    http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/registry/ARB/get_proc_address.txt
    http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/ABI/

  See also the GLAF project ("OpenGL Advanced Functionality"), which
  wraps extensions etc in a portable framework (available under an
  MIT-license):

     http://webs.ono.com/usr003/cesarblecua/

* An application partly covering the ideas behind our "gl-attack"
  suggested project: <URL:http://glean.sourceforge.net>.

* Troll Tech's Technical FAQ for Qt contains information about what we
  can _not_ do when we want to keep ABI compatibility in new releases:

    <URL:http://www.trolltech.com/developer/faqs/technical.html>

* Distributed Open Inventor:

    <URL:http://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/vr/div/>

  Also in the proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality
  Software and Technology (VRST'99), pp. 74-81, 1999.

* There's supposedly a shadow demo on www.opengl.org, with source
  code, which demonstrates how to do shadows on all kinds of (NVidia)
  gfx cards, from TNT (sw shadow volumes) to GeForce 3 (hardware
  shadow mapping).

* This link has some useful information on doing hardware-supported
  dynamic shadowing on NVidia gfx-cards:

    <URL:http://developer.nvidia.com/view.asp?IO=hwshadowmap_paper>

* A 3D model search engine (with lots of VRML models, at least):

  from the HACKING file.
