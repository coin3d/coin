*   libCgGL loading triggered at SoDB::init().

    The Cg library, used by the fragment and vertex shader
    functionality only, is attempted (dynamically) loaded at start-up
    of any Coin application.

    This causes a completely unnecessary delay at start-up, which may
    be noticeable on systems with a long list of directories with
    shared object files (.so or .dll files)
