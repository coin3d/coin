WHAT'S THIS?
============

This document contains a list of various deficiencies in Coin that are
not "large enough" to warrant them being listed as full projects in
the docs/projects.txt file, and probably not "small enough" to be
fixed within an hour or two.

See also the api-wish-list.txt file for other "mini" projects.


Important note: I (mortene@sim.no) believe it would in general be a
good idea if as many as possible of the SIM developers involved in
Coin development "cleaned the table" to make time for a "Coin2" summit
well before we are closing in on a release date for version
2.0.0. Preferably such a summit could be held for a number of days,
maybe even as much as ~ a whole week.

The reasons for this is that there's quite a number of important
design issues for all the new functionality (implemented and planned)
we should *really* think through before setting them in stone, as we
don't want to end up with second-rate API-stuff that we have to
support indefinitely in future Coin versions.

So presentations and round-table discussions around API-extensions for
Coin v2 would be a Really Good Thing to plan for -- sometime in late
Q1 2002 or early Q2 2002, perhaps.



STUFF TO FIX IN COIN
====================

000 Improve error reporting on texture loading
    2001-11-24  Morten Eriksen  <mortene@sim.no>

    The only message one can get now is "Couldn't load texture
    blablabla". This is a rather lousy error message for both the
    end-user and for the application programmer.

    We should have code which could at least recognize and spit out
    error messages in these categories:

        * no texture loading library available (which is only simage
          at the moment, but could be others) -- NOTE: NOW FIXED

        * could not find texture file <filename> in any of these
          directories: <searchlist>

        * found texture file at <fullfilename>, recognized file format
          as 'X', which is not supported with this build of the simage
          library

        * found texture file at <fullfilename>, but does not recognize
          file format

        * found texture file at <fullfilename>, but file seems
          damaged

    The place to start is SbImage, but SbImage's "clients" might also
    needs changes. We will probably also have to fix libsimage to make
    more specific error reports.

    UPDATE 2002-06-17 mortene: I've made a few improvements (for both
    Coin-1 and Coin-dev), so one will now at least get better
    reporting if simage is missing.


001 A "stopwatch" for built-in profiling support
    2001-11-27  Morten Eriksen  <mortene@sim.no>

    Support for on-the-fly profiling would be very nice. It could help
    us with the heuristics for the OpenGL displaylist render caching,
    for instance.

    We can't use the real-time time of day for this -- we need to
    measure the process/CPU-time for just the current thread to get
    proper data for this type of profiling.

    There's an ANSI C function -- clock() -- which gives us the CPU
    time used by a process.

    If that doesn't do what we want, on MSWin we could use
    GetProcessTimes() or GetThreadTimes(), and there's a POSIX
    function for doing it on UNIX-style platforms; times() (plus we
    need to use the POSIX sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK) to find the clocktick
    value to multiply with).

    Interface suggestion:

        cc_time cc_time_get_cpu_time()  (public C++ API: SbTime::getCPUTime())

    ..and then a "stopwatch-like" interface on top of that:

        cc_stopwatch * cc_stopwatch_create(void)
        void cc_stopwatch_start(cc_stopwatch *)
        cc_time cc_stopwatch_stop(cc_stopwatch *)
        void cc_stopwatch_destroy(cc_stopwatch *)

    ..where cc_stopwatch would simply be

        struct cc_stopwatch {
          cc_time start;
        };

    ..or perhaps it could be just a

        typedef cc_time cc_stopwatch;


    One possible "gotcha": the OS-specific cpu-time functions must
    have a resolution high enough to time even very short intervals
    for this to be useful, I would assume. Perhaps a

        cc_time cc_time_get_cpu_time_resolution(void)

    would be a good idea.


002 Heed the SoBoundingBoxCache::hasLinesOrPoints() settings
    2001-11-27  Morten Eriksen  <mortene@sim.no>

    We should add a slack value to bounding boxes with lines and/or
    points in them, to avoid clipping artifacts when anti-aliasing is
    used.

    (This concerns both client code in the Coin library and in the So*
    libraries which calculates and renders bounding boxes.)

    As part of this, we should audit to check that all relevant
    shape-type nodes uses the
    SoBoundingBoxCaches::setHasLinesOrPoints() method.


003 Clean up the file versioning mess
    2001-11-28  Morten Eriksen  <mortene@sim.no>

    Scenegraphs exported through the SoWriteAction should have a
    correct header to reflect the actual contents. As it is now,
    everything is just written as Inventor v2.1, even if there are
    nodes from Inventor >2.1, or nodes specific for Coin, or even
    VRML-specific nodes.

    To make it possible to do this, it seems likely that we need some
    way of tagging API elements that can be exported to file -- ie
    primarily nodes and engines -- with some kind of versioning
    identification. So that's a prerequisite.

    I believe we need both a dynamic flag on an SoNode to know which
    specific file format version it was read from (if any, it could
    have been new'ed from the application aswell), plus an OR-flag on
    each class which specifies which formats it is valid for (to be
    used during write).

    As part of this setup, we'll also need to handle "upgrading"
    during reads, as some nodes had their field specification changed
    from for instance Inventor v2.0 to Inventor v2.1 (e.g. the
    SoPackedColor node changed the name of it's one field from "rgb"
    to "orderedRGBA", and also changed the semantics of the uint32_t
    word in the field).

    This last problem should probably be solved by having e.g. an
    alternate SoPackedColorV20 node-class, which would be instantiated
    during read, and then converted to an >= Inventor v2.1 format
    SoPackedColor node.

    Update 2002-06-17 mortene: pederb has laid out the foundations
    necessary by setting up bitmasks and API methods on
    SoNode. Inventor2.0 import should be ok. Export "compability
    detection" has not been done yet, though.

    Update 2002-10-29 mortene: one additional word of warning from
    kintel is that '+' is not allowed to be used as the 1st character
    of a node name identifier under VRML97.

    Update 2002-11-05 mortene: estimate made at our November 2002 SIM
    Coin summit; "1 man-week should be more than sufficient".


004 Re-design the public API for handling textures
    2001-11-28  Peder Blekken  <pederb@sim.no>, write-down by mortene@sim.no

    The available public API for handling textures from SGI / TGS
    Inventor (ie SoTexture2 with friends) is seriously
    under-developed, and contains many flaws.

    Our work on a project where we developed a very advanced
    terrain-visualization extension has resulted in lots of extra
    functionality in Coin (SoGLImage, SoGLBigImage, delayed, parallel
    loading of textures in SbImage, etc etc) which will strengthen the
    support for texture handling immensely. Because of the limitations
    of the basic SoTexture2 (et al) design, it seems hard to retrofit
    this into the current design in a pretty way, though.

    So what should be done is to make a new design where all of this
    is

        a) fitted into the *basic* Inventor API design principles, but
           in new classes

        b) still hide as much complexity as possible for the
           application programmer, while still retaining the necessary
           level of flexibility

        c) if possible, layer the present public API classes and
            methods (ie SoTexture2 et al again) on top of the new,
            good design

        d) make sure we keep the old API functioning as before for the
           sake of compatibility with external client applications

        e) add support for new image types. Currently only 8 bits per
           component is supported, but to save texture memory it is
           often useful to support other image modes, such as textures
           with palettes (as can be done in OpenGL with
           GL_EXT_paletted_texture) and/or 16 bits RGB.

    All this should _absolutely_ be done before we close up on the v2
    release, as after v2 it will likely be a while until we get the
    chance to do larger API / design changes again.


005 Support compressed textures
    2002-01-03  Thomas Hammer  <thammer@sim.no>, writeup by <mortene@sim.no>

    The S3TC extension is widely supported on many common graphics
    cards from a wide range of vendors (NVidia, S3 (duh!), ATI, 3dfx,
    more?), so we should implement support for it to aid more
    efficient resource handling with regard to texturemaps.

    See <URL:http://www.pseudonymz.demon.co.uk/s3tcoglext.htm> for
    more information (note: there is probably more elaborate
    descriptions available elsewhere).

    Also, check out the GL_ARB_texture_compression extension:
    <URL:http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/registry/ARB/texture_compression.txt>.

    Plus (for at least OpenGL 1.3): the glCompressedTexImage*()
    functions.


006 Font specification
    2001-11-28  Morten Eriksen  <mortene@sim.no>

    There's really no good mechanism in the API for setting detailed,
    OS-portable font information. The API of the SoFont and
    SoFontStyle nodes is pretty lousy.

    We should re-design and layer the old API / classes on top of our
    new and improved design.

    2001-11-29 larsa: We should probably actually implement loading of
    external fonts first :)


007 Auto-generation of MSVC++ project files
    2001-11-28  Morten Eriksen  <mortene@sim.no>

    Many MSWin users who want to be able to re-compile Coin and SoWin
    and / or SoQt from scratch to suit their own needs with regard to
    compilation flags etc, would like to be able to do so by using
    MSVC++ project files (.dsw or .dsp) instead of the configure-based
    setup.

    It should be possible for us to make the configure script generate
    such files automatically.

    There are basically two ways to do this: a) either demand that
    ``configure'' still be run on the client side to generate the
    .dsp, or b) provide the MSVC++ .dsp with no requirements for
    Cygwin installation and fiddling at all. The former option would
    be more flexible, the latter option would be more convenient for
    our users. The latter option may not be feasible, though.

    It would perhaps be a good idea to implement a) first, and then
    look into the extra hassle of doing b), as a) seems to be a
    pre-requisite for b) anyhow.

    Here are a few ideas of how to solve some of the problems that
    will come up:

        * If we go for the b) alternative mentioned above (no Cygwin
          or configure run necessary), we will need "static"
          MSWin-valid versions of these three configure-generated
          files: config.h, inttypes.h and SbBasic.h.

          I suggest we either run ``configure'' on a "minimum",
          bare-bones MSWin box and add them to the Coin repository
          proper, for instance with "win32-" prefixes, or perhaps in
          their own "win32" directory.

        * We absolutely need to be able to re-generate the .dsp file
          from a template that automatically includes all the correct
          sourcecode files, include paths, link options, etc without
          any manual intervention. Manual intervention means that
          things will eventually get out of sync, with the headaches
          that follow.

          I assume we can use a ``configure'' run to generate the
          dsp-file from a .dsp.in file. It seems probable that we also
          need some kind of additional processing during the
          generation -- configure's substitution mechanism may not be
          enough. We will for instance need to set up lists of which
          files to compile in a format that are not
          "substitution-friendly" for configure. We should strive to
          use the common configure mechanisms to solve our problems as
          far as it's possible, though.

        * We will need a complete list of which files to compile.

          The *.lst-generation mechanism now used in all sourcecode
          sub-directories can probably be applied again.

    I think it could also be worth looking into the ability to
    generate client application project files automatically in the
    same manner, for instance in the SoGuiExamples module. That would
    lower the bar on entry for many MSWin / MSVC++ programmers.

    Update 2002-12-10 mortene: there's a small Perl-script in he Wine
    project, called 'msvcmaker', that I believe converts from
    Makefile.in files to a .dsp or a .dsw. Check it out, it might be
    something we could build on.


008 Dynamic loading of external extension nodes
    2001-11-29  Lars J. Aas  <larsa@sim.no>

    This functionality is missing in Coin.  Do we need to do it the
    same way as SGI/TGS from the get go?  I don't think so.  How about
    ignoring the C++ mangling problem and just having a special C
    symbol (like 'extern "C" void init(void);', only less likely to
    collide with other symbols) for initing the loaded node for the
    first implementation?  Supporting C++ name mangling can be tackled
    later...

    Update 2002-02-12 mortene: this looks to be a decent resource on
    name mangling for the MSVC++ compiler (and it includes some links
    to G++ info aswell): <URL:http://www.kegel.com/mangle.html>.


009 Mac OS X framework setup
    2001-12-05  Lars J. Aas  <larsa@sim.no>

    Port the Mac OS X framework setup from Coin-1 to the Coin
    development branch.


010 Make Coin Usable from ROM
    2001-12-19  Lars J. Aas  <larsa@sim.no>

    Investigate if all static writable data can be avoided so Coin can
    be run from ROM (important for embedded systems).  This is just an
    idea - didn't find a more appropriate place to put it.


011 Rethink handling of camera properties and display configuration.
    2002-02-01  Morten Eriksen  <mortene@sim.no>

    I have a nagging feeling that the camera model is not as good as
    it should be, we are for instance mixing up display-dependent
    configuration settings (like stereo mode stuff) with actual
    view-matrix pr-camera configuration stuff (like orthographic vs
    perspective matrix settings, field-of-view, etc).  I can't see why
    the former should belong within the SoCamera node, as I don't
    think it gives any meaning to change stereo settings during
    traversal, for instance.

    Java3D probably has a better design here than the original
    Inventor API provides, so anyone taking on this task should at
    least investigate their model.


012 The SoSphere should be tessellated better.
    2002-02-19  Morten Eriksen  <mortene@sim.no>

    It is now tessellated to quads, in a way that makes the visual
    quality not as good as it should be.  SGI / TGS Inventor's
    SoSphere is (at least partly) triangulated, and looks better.


013 Implement an alternative to using macros for specifying nodekit parts.
    2002-02-20  Peder Blekken  <pederb@sim.no>

    The SO_KIT_ADD_CATALOG_ENTRY macro(s) is quite large and complex,
    and when expanded for all draggers and nodekits it probably adds
    several 100 KBytes to the Coin library. A good solution would
    probably be to specify the node kit parts using text strings, and
    implement one function that will interpret the strings and
    initialize the node kit parts without using macros.


014 Make rendering (and other operations) robust for inconsistent scenegraphs.
    2002-05-13  Morten Eriksen  <mortene@sim.no>

    We should audit our rendering (and related) code and fix all cases
    were we lack robustness for at least the most common mistakes.

    Being able to import or otherwise construct iv-models that render
    without crashing upon slight errors is important for the general
    robustness of applications built on top of Coin. It will also be
    important for the miscellaneous planned multithreaded
    functionality.


015 100% correct transparency mode.
    2002-05-15  Morten Eriksen  <mortene@sim.no>

    Even the best transparency mode in Coin will still fail under
    certain circumstances, such as intersecting polygons. It would
    probably be very slow (and quite hard to implement), but we should
    give the user the option to pick a transparency mode where
    rendering is guaranteed to be correct -- if at all possible.

    See also the comments about this in the technical ``FAQ'' file on
    the root of the sourcecode archive.

    For Nvidia specific hardware/drivers:
      <URL:http://developer.nvidia.com/view.asp?IO=Interactive_Order_Transparency>
      <URL:http://developer.nvidia.com/view.asp?IO=order_independent_transparency>


016 Detect multiple instances of the Coin library within the same run-time application space.
    2002-06-18  Morten Eriksen  <mortene@sim.no>

    This seems to happen time and again with app programmers
    "double-linking" with So* and Coin at the same time, causing two
    Coin instances to live in memory -- which quickly causes a
    mysterious looking crash.

    We should use some kind of "intra-app" communication mechanism
    under MSWindows to detect this case and throw up a big, fat error
    message before exiting.

    (Then pass on a patch to TrollTech, so they can do the same thing
    with Qt -- that would relieve us of the common problems of app
    programmers double-linking against Qt through SoQt and their
    app-code.)


017 Move action-style code developed in other projects into proper actions.
    2002-07-05  Morten Eriksen  <mortene@sim.no>

    Peder has already written much of the code needed for the TGS
    Inventor SoToVRMLAction class, and Kintel has written code which
    could fit into the TGS SoReorganizeAction class.

    It's important to get this code into proper classes, so they are
    used by a larger audience, adding value to the Coin library we
    offer, so the code will be maintained instead of bit-rotting, etc
    etc.

    UPDATE 2002-09-03 mortene: SoToVRMLAction (and SoToVRML2Action)
    has now been implemented (by summer intern Kristian Eide).


018 Check out and build simage as part of the Coin build process.
    2002-08-01  Morten Eriksen  <mortene@sim.no>

    This would:

        * kill a bunch of common support problems for us

        * it seems somewhat favorable anyway to make the Coin library
          guaranteed "usable" with regard to textures, with no
          external dependencies

        * make it less likely that the simage sourcecode is slowly
          rotting away

    Note that we should still keep simage as a separate CVS project,
    as it could be usable in other contexts. We should also set up a
    configure option that makes it possible to _exclude_ simage from
    Coin build, as not everyone needs to be able to load textures
    from disk.


019 Dynamically configurable viewer interaction (SoQt++)
    2002-09-30  Lars J. Aas  <larsa@sim.no>

    It would be better if the interaction functionality of the
    ExaminerViewer, PlaneViewer, etc. were implemented at the FullViewer
    level (or even Viewer), and the leaf viewer classes mostly differed
    in how it hooked the different interaction functionality up to the
    different user interactions in the constructor through some generic
    interaction configuration API.  A side-effect would be that an
    ExaminerViewer could at run-tim be reconfigured to act as a FlyViewer,
    but the main reason for doing this is to separate user interactions
    from how the viewer responds, and make this more configurable, and
    shrink the implementations of the leaf viewers to the absolute minimum.


020 SoSub*.h improvements.
    2002-10-08  Morten Eriksen  <mortene@sim.no>

    I'm sure many of the macros in these files could be made into
    inline functions, simple template functions, or just better laid
    out macros. They should be audited with this in mind.

    One particular complaint we've had from a Coin user is that the
    current macros are in general not compatible with template-based
    extensions classes (at least not for nodes, haven't really
    investigated the rest).


021 Call-stack backtraces on errors.
    2002-11-26  Morten Eriksen  <mortene@sim.no>

    In the "Under The Hood" column in the May 1997 issue of the
    Microsoft Systems Journal, Matt Pietrek explains how one can use
    REBASE.EXE and the IMAGEHLP.DLL for getting a full list of
    call-stack frames -- even for release builds.

    Integrating something like this in Coin, and then catching crash
    signals (if this is possible under MSWin..) could be a helpful
    feature.


022 VRML97 VRMLScript scripting node.
    2002-12-18  Morten Eriksen  <mortene@sim.no>

    (Merged from the "hotlist" after our November 2002 SIM Coin
    summit.)

    Can probably be based on the Javascript engine from the Mozilla
    project. Script node interface should be mostly in place, only a
    couple or three days of extra work. But we should also add in the
    time needed to make it fit into the configure/build process, which
    is some days extra -- hard to make a good estimate on that.


023 SoCollisionManager & So@Gui@CollisionViewer.
    2002-12-18  Morten Eriksen  <mortene@sim.no>

    (Merged from the "hotlist" after our November 2002 SIM Coin
    summit.)

    From TGS's Inventor API additions. larsa's estimate: ~ 1 man-week.


024 Optimizing the performance of the SoIntersectionDetectionAction.
    2002-12-18  Morten Eriksen  <mortene@sim.no>

    (Merged from the "hotlist" after our November 2002 SIM Coin
    summit.)

    Now uses an algorithm with O(n^2) asymptotic time, where n is the
    number of triangle primitives. This renders it almost unusable.

    larsa's estimate for optimizing away the horrible algorithm-time:
    a bit more than 1 man-week.

    kintel has been working on this, but decided to go for a solution
    where he integrates another library. This library is ok to use for
    kintel's application, but can not be integrated into Coin due to
    license and/or copyright issues.


025 Integrate QGL into SoQt.
    2002-12-18  Morten Eriksen  <mortene@sim.no>

    (Merged from the "hotlist" after our November 2002 SIM Coin
    summit.)

    Should be done to make it possible to fix a bunch of bugs that QGL
    has. Shouldn't take more than ~ 1 man-week to fix properly,
    including full configure/build integration.


026 WWW-interface on Coin / SoWin / SoQt builds.
    2002-12-18  Morten Eriksen  <mortene@sim.no>

    An idea in the "wild, crazy and cool" department; it would have
    been really nifty if we could provide Coin-users on MSWindows a
    www-interface where they could

      a) set up the parameters for how they wanted their MSWindows
         Coin / SoQt / SoWin DLL / LIB to be (static vs dynamic,
         release vs debug, which C run-time library to use, with or
         without exception support, with or without RTTI, at what
         optimization level, eventually which compiler to use, etc
         etc), and then;

      b) the wanted configuration would be found and a link to
         downloading it would be presented

      c) if the configuration was not present, a build of that config
         was triggered, with a message to the user to check back in 15
         minutes (this config would of course then be stored, so
         future attempts to download it from other users would be
         immediately gratified)

    This should of course all run on a Linux www server, so we would
    need to be able to run all necessary dependencies under Wine
    (Cygwin?, MSVC's command-line tools, SuperPIMP, ...).


027 Build Coin / SoQt / SoWin on MSWin without relying on MSVC++.
    2003-01-10  Morten Eriksen  <mortene@sim.no>

    It would be nice if MSWin developers could work with Coin without
    having to buy the expensive MSVS suite. Doubly nice would be if we
    ported it to compilers that are free.

    Likely candidates for porting efforts includes at least:

        - OpenWatcom (<URL:http://www.openwatcom.org>)
        - Cygwin GCC (<URL:http://www.cygwin.com>)
        - MingW (URL?)
        - Borland's C++ compiler
        - Digital Mars C/C++ compiler (<URL:http://www.digitalmars.com>)

028 Support for multiple viewports in render areas
    2003-01-22 Marius Kintel <kintel@sim.no>

    To make it easy to create multiple viewports, we should have a high-level
    API for this (in SoGuiRenderArea), smth. like this:
    void addSceneGraph(SoNode*, SbViewportRegion)
    void removeSceneGraph(SoNode*)
    
    Issues:
    o We should be able to control a larger subset of the API of the
      SoGuiRenderArea which can be cumbersome with this approach.
    
    Solution:
    class SoViewportArea:
    o set/get scene graph, bgcolor, overlays, transparency, aliasing,
      clearing, rendering priority (render order), scene manager,
      renderaction.
    o Let the above add function return a default SoViewportArea for ease of
      use.
    o Let some or all of the existing functions affect all viewport areas
      (global override).
    
    in SoGuiRenderAres:
    o Add SoViewportArea instances
    o Remap event coordinates for each viewport area (in reverse render
      priority order) and send the event to each of their scene graphs (like
      we do now for the overlay/normal scene managers.
    
    We also have to resolve the camera issue somehow; control cameras per
    viewport area vs. sharing cameras between viewport areas, sync cameras
    with the viewer, control view/pick mode per viewport area.


029 Better font support.
    2003-01-30  Morten Eriksen  <mortene@sim.no>

    This is a braindump of my ideas and hints for how to go about this
    task:

     * We should be able to load TrueType fonts, which I believe would
       give us, our users, and our users's users good flexibility.

       The obvious choice for getting support for TTF seems to be by
       using the FreeType library (<URL:http://www.freetype.org>).

       The FreeType library has a license which is liberal enough that
       we can actually embed the source code into the Coin source
       code. There are good arguments both for and against this
       strategy. On the plus side, that would make packaging and
       distribution easier and more "fail-safe", both for us, other
       Coin users and for the end-users of Coin-based application
       software. On the other hand, this would give us more work with
       regard to keeping in sync with the FreeType projects bug-fixes
       and other upgrades.

       If we don't embed the FreeType library, we should let it be
       dynamically loaded through a run-time binding, like we do for
       simage, GLU and OpenAL.

     * We have feedback from a Coin-user (Daniel Alvarez) that going
       up one extra level of abstraction (from using FreeType
       directly) would give us some important advantages. Check with
       him what the arguments are.

       SGI Inventor does this through their "libFL" library.

     * Handle Unicode charactersets -- just ASCII or iso-8859-[1|15]
       is not enough.

       (<URL:http://www.wikipedia.org> is a great place to go and read
       oneself up on Unicode, UTF-8, UTF-16, iso-8859-*, and character
       encodings in general.)

     * One important aspect of the implementation is to get the
       internal class abstraction for handling glyphs correctly. The
       current SoGlyph class probably leaves a lot to be wanted.

     * We should try to get hold of one or more full-featured TrueType
       font(s) to embed as a binary file into Coin -- as a fallback in
       case no TT fonts can be found on the run-time system.

       See the Coin/docs/misc-resources.txt file for URLs to free font
       resources.


030 Offscreen context support functions.
    2003-01-31  Morten Eriksen  <mortene@sim.no>

    There's a hack in use which should be cleaned out: from several
    places in the Coin source code, an SoOffscreenRenderer is set up
    with a single SoCallback node scene graph -- just as a hack to get
    a current offscreen GL context.

    As of now, this trick is used by the SoExtSelection node and the
    code which wraps the GLU nurbs tessellation functions (which needs
    a current GL context for some weird reason).

    This should be cleaned up by making available an internal set of
    functions (perhaps on the gl wrapper interface?):

        glcontextstruct * make_offscreen_context(...);
        glcontextstruct * set_current_context(glcontextstruct *); /* returns previous context */
        void free_offscreen_context(glcontextstruct *);

    The code for these methods has basically been written already, and
    is now contained within the Coin/src/misc/SoOffscreen* files. It
    should be moved out of there, and SoOffscreenRenderer,
    SoExtSelection and the GLU nurbs tesselation wrapping should all
    use the new methods.

    Note that setting up an offscreen GL context uses
    platform-dependent code, and is implemented for 3 different
    systems: GLX (X11), WGL (MSWin) and AGL (Mac OS X).



OTHER COIN-RELATED STUFF TO FIX
===============================

These are from a "hotlist" of items after our November 2002 SIM Coin
summit -- i.e. tasks that we should try really hard to get resources
for in upcoming projects:

   * Profit library made release-ready: ~ 2-3 days.

   * Dime library made release-ready: ~ 2-3 days.

   * Use simacros for old projects (Coin-1, Coin, SoQt, SoWin, Profit,
     Dime, etc etc) instead of conf-macros: ~ 1/2 day for each
     project.
