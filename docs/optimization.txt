============================================================================

General guidelines:
===================

  * levels of optimization (sorted in order of impact):

        i) asymptotic algorithm time (list traversal, sorting, etc)

       ii) caching strategies (and implementations)

      iii) low-level stuff (piping data to OpenGL, inlining of
           functions, etc)

     i) should be more-or-less ok in Coin. There might be major
     remaining tasks at ii). The obvious stuff at iii) is in the Sb*
     classes; SbVec3f, SbMatrix etc, but we need decent profiling to
     expose the bottlenecks.

     One important thing to note about case iii) is the fact that we
     should _really_ have some kind of regression testing system in
     place before we start optimization of the basic classes, to avoid
     introducing hard-to-find bugs.


  * tasks for optimizations:
        0) try to single out interesting areas for profiling

        1) make a good test case for one particular area
        2) optional: show us the testcode for approval & feedback
        3) do extensive profiling
        4) analyze results
        5) optional: present them for sanity checking
        6) optimize
        7) submit fixes as patches 
        8) goto 1

    About step 1): it would be good to make testcases which could be
    made permanent for routine checks on the performance. Maybe we
    could even automate this with the aid of one of the tools from the
    Mozilla project?

  * interesting areas to fix (roughly in sorted order):

        - traversal in general, rendering and picking in particular
          ("optimization-by-caching") -- this is first priority

        - file import / parsing (and export?)

        - startup-time (for instance measured for the
          examples/components/examinerviewer executable)

        - user interaction through draggers & manipulators, must
          secure decent responsiveness

============================================================================

Concrete tasks:
===============

        * Implement a framerate counter in the So*ExaminerViewer, to
          make it easier to get a "feeling" on which scenes / shapes /
          whatever that have bad rendering performance.

          Update on this task: code for showing a FPS counter is now
          in place in SoGuiViewer.cpp.in, but it is just a hack so far
          and needs to be enabled by an environment variable. See
          comments in the sourcecode file about what should be done to
          include it properly in the public API of the
          So[Qt|Gtk|Xt|Win|...]Viewer class.

        * SoSeparator rendercaching (with OpenGL renderlists)
          mechanisms is not default activated yet. (At least I think
          so, ask pederb about this.)

        * We've not yet implemented any heuristics on the "AUTO"
          setting for caching in SoSeparator (so far, we only do
          bounding box caching) -- we just default to "ON", which can
          be _very_ lousy behaviour with regards to performance.

        * From a quick peek at the code, it looks like
          SoMField-derived classes calls (or may call) valueChanged()
          multiple times from certain functions.

        * Trace the notification mechanisms to see if we send
          superfluous notification messages (field->field,
          field->node, node->node, ...).

          Update: pederb has looked into and optimized at least some
          parts of this.

        * SoTabBoxDragger rendering seems particularly slow on my PII
          266MHZ laptop -- why? The dragger geometry looks simple
          enough, and draggers with more complex geometries seems to
          render with far better performance.

        * Optimize SoState and element handling, for better traversal
          performance in general. Some ideas:

           - create our own memory allocator for allocating
             SoElement-derived classes, freeing them all at once in
             the destructor.

           - SoElement::copyMatchInfo() would then need to use a
             separate memory allocator, probably handled by the cache
             copying the element.

           - consider adding SoState::popElements(const SbList
             <SoType> &list), to make it possible to pop only selected
             elements (dangerous stuff. Ask pederb why he needs this).

          (Note: should investigate a bit (i.e. do profiling) before
          deciding if this is really worth the effort.)

        * Consider adding SoModelMatrixElement::getInverse(SoState*)
          to enable inverse model matrix caching. The inverse model
          matrix is used quite frequently, and we now have to do this
          every time it is needed:

            SbMatrix inv = SoModelMatrixElement::get(state).inverse();

        * Implement the Large Model Viewing extensions of later TGS
          Inventor releases:

                So(Global|Shape)SimplifyAction, SoReorganizeAction,
                SoRenderList node, SoOctreeOrdering node,
                SoSimplifier, SoDecimator,
                SoDecimationPercentageElement,
                So*Viewer::setGoalFramesPerSecond(), etc

          (This is a large task.)

        * Make use of OpenGL 1.1 and 1.2 features which have the
          potential to speed up rendering (vertexarrays, for instance
          (but note: vertexarrays are "incompatible" with GL display
          lists)).

        * Write code to find information about the graphics
          accelerator card on run-time, and choose rendering methods
          with optimized paths. This is very low-priority yet, though.

============================================================================

Priorities:
===========

General areas where performance is important for the application
programmer. "More critical" is closer to the top of the list:

        0 Rendering
        1 File import
        2 Response time with draggers / manipulators
        3 Intersection testing
        4 Application start-up time
        5 General traversal operations
        6 Scene graph modifications
        7 Basic math/geometry classes
        8 File export
